+ Confirmation before deleting a subscription (thank you Akeebafan!)
+ Confirmation before deleting a subscription level (thank you Akeebafan!)
+ Won't allow deleting a subscription level anymore when there are subscriptions referencing it
~ Changed the name validation text to reflect that two words are required

# "Content - Akeeba Subscriptions Restricted" would not work under Joomla! 1.6
# "Content - Akeeba Subscriptions Link" would not work under Joomla! 1.6
# "Content - Akeeba Subscriptions Restricted" would throw a notice under Joomla! 1.5
# "Content - Akeeba Subscriptions Link" would throw a notice under Joomla! 1.5
# Rogue index.html copied to site's root could make the site look as if it's throwing a blank page
# The -noframework package would allow you to install the component even when Nooku Framework was not already installed
# Payment plugins would produce wrong callback/redirection URLs if the site is in a subdirectory
# Warning thrown by aslink plugin when all subscription levels are removed
# Supplying a misspelled group name in integration plugins could create invalid entries referencing inexistent group #0 in the 3PD components' user-group mapping tables
# Regression: User wouldn't see the "Thank you" page after completing a payment
# URLs in subscription notification and expiration emails would contain the path doubled
# Users could get away without typing a surname if they added two spaces after their first name.
# If the user created a subscription level without a slug, an error would be thrown instead of automatically creating a slug from the title
# On pages with validation errors you wouldn't get the entered values back on the page when it reloaded.
# Internal Server Error thrown if you try to create a subscription with a from/to date which doesn't have a time part (e.g. 2012-07-14 instead of 2012-07-14 00:00:00)
# Picking a user in the back-end Subscriptions, Coupon and User editors doesn't work under FF5
# Some morons have actually written plugins which remove any script references to "jquery.js", loading their own version of jQuery, completely screwing up the registration page. These sorry excuses of developers should be tarred, feathered and stringed! Worked around by renaming our jQuery file.
# The "Back to the frontpage" link in the order/cancellation message pages had a rather misleading title (just "Back")
# The PayPal image wouldn't load before the redirection. Changed the Javscript auto-submit code to use onLoad instead of DOM ready event to work around that. Big THANK YOU to akeebafan for this patch!
# Some plugins were not being installed
# Menubar (right below the toolbar) doesn't render properly on Joomla! 1.6/1.7
# Pressing Apply on the Configuration page redirected you to the Dashboard page
# Sometimes pressing Save or Apply would redirect you to a another page of the component that you had meanwhile opened in another tab or window. Eek!
# Delayed payments' IPN with PayPal (e.g. e-checks) would not be processed

Akeeba Subscriptions 1.0.b4
================================================================================

+ You can now use content plugins in the Subscription Level descriptions; thanks akeebafan for this idea!
+ You can now use content plugins in the subscription level's order and cancellation messages
+ More stringent pre-installation tests to make sure that if your server is not compatible with Akeeba Subscriptions the component won't be installed, no matter what!
# Warnings thrown on PHP 5.3 servers where the default timezone in not set
# Uninstalling the component would break the site as the plugins were not uninstalled because Joomla! always failed to copy and use the uninstallation file.
# The "Off-line" payment plugin would not have its title translated in the new subscription page
# If the name provided in aslink plugin is not valid, you get a PHP Notice; thanks akeebafan
# aslink doesn't produce correct URL if Joomla installed in subfolder (subfolder is "doubled" in path); thanks akeebafan
