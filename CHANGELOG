Akeeba Subscriptions 2.0.a2
================================================================================
# Front-end levels view: the ordering set in the back-end was not being honoured
# Could not save subscription limits on coupons
# Only the first coupon would be considered during payment
# If you order a view by a field which doesn't exist in the next view, the next view shows no records
# If FOF is not present for any reason, the system and content plugins will crash your site
# Sometimes the front-end level view would try to erroneously use the "awesome" layout instead of the "default"
# Instances of \n in the registration email text were not converted to newlines
# config.xml typo caused the email body to be used as the email header
# Unpublished subscription levels would show up in the front-end
# Renew link would not be shown for all published levels and not hidden for all unpublished levels in the My Subscriptions view
