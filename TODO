- Resellers. A triangular sale: Reseller charges the user and uses our API to get a voucher (coupon) code. The user uses the coupon code on our site to subscribe. The reseller gets charged when the coupon is used.
- Linked subscriptions. User B "inherits" the subscriptions of User A. Every change in User A's subscription status is replicated to User B. One-to-many relationship to ease the transition.
- Front-end: Allow user to alter his account information
