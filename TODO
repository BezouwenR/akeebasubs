To-do:
- Signup: Show a message when there are validation errors after the user submits the form
- XML files for front-end views
- MODULE site/akeebasubs : Display a list of active / all subscriptions
- MODULE site/akslevels : Display a customisable list of subscription levels (HMVC - f/e levels view with ID filtering using the model's state)
- Allow the Levels view to not display the subscriptions list (page parameters)
- PLUGIN content/aksubscribe {aksubscribe SLUG|ID} => URL to subscription page of that level
- Documentation!

- Resellers. A triangular sale: Reseller charges the user and uses our API to get a voucher (coupon) code. The user uses the coupon code on our site to subscribe. The reseller gets charged when the coupon is used.
- Linked subscriptions. User B "inherits" the subscriptions of User A. Every change in User A's subscription status is replicated to User B. One-to-many relationship to ease the transition.
- Front-end: Allow user to alter his account information
