To-do / bug fixes:
================================================================================
----------------------------------------
			Back-end
----------------------------------------
+ User details list and form views (users and user views)
+ HTML invoices
+ Import of Greek a/b files
+ Auto-generate or manually generate invoices
+ Email invoices to clients on generation
+ Invoices report (Intrastat, VAT, free-form filter) & CSV export

----------------------------------------
			Front-end
----------------------------------------
# The automatic discount is not visible when you first load the page.
	We have to run the validation code when the page loads and use the pricing information
	from the validation results.
+ Option to show/hide the steps bar
+ Option to disable business registrations
+ Option to disable collection of address information
+ Clients can download their invoices anytime

- Invoicing, manual (issue or import invoice) or auto, ability to import Greek tax device's b.txt files
- Affiliates. Links an affiliate to a coupon code and calculates the total commissions per term (e.g. per month)
- Resellers. A triangular sale: Reseller charges the user and uses our API to get a voucher (coupon) code. The user uses the coupon code on our site to subscribe. The reseller gets charged when the coupon is used.
- Linked subscriptions. User B "inherits" the subscriptions of User A. Every change in User A's subscription status is replicated to User B. One-to-many relationship to ease the transition.
- Front-end: Allow user to alter his account information

================================================================================
On ice (probably never going to happen)
================================================================================
- Add/remove to RedShop groups (it's supposed to be free, but asks me to pay 29 Euros?! Bye.)
- Add/remove subscriptions based on Redshop purchases (it's supposed to be free, but asks me to pay 29 Euros?! Bye.)
- Add/remove to SOBI2 (component handles its own payments; you can't do otherwise)
- Add/remove to SOBIPro (component handles its own payments; its group system is convoluted that makes the integration very prone to breaking badly)
