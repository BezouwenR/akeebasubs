Bugs(?):
- If a disabled user info is passed, it doesn't say that the user account is already in use. Why?
- Subscription doesn't work when adding a new user?
- The messages view doesn't work (results to page without content) when POST is used. Hardwire it to a read action, like the callback view + add it to safe views list in the dispatcher

To-do:
- Refactor plugins (except system and content) to use Koowa dispatcher: http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/nooku-framework/Using_Plugins
- Backend: AMBRA.subscriptions import feature
- MODULE admin/akstats : Display (textual) statistics
- MODULE admin/akcharts : Display (graphical, charts) statistics
- MODULE site/akeebasubs : Display a list of active / all subscriptions (HMVC)
- MODULE site/akslevels : Display a customisable list of subscription levels (HMVC)

- Affiliates. Links an affiliate to a coupon code and calculates the total commissions per term (e.g. per month)
- Resellers. A triangular sale: Reseller charges the user and uses our API to get a voucher (coupon) code. The user uses the coupon code on our site to subscribe. The reseller gets charged when the coupon is used.
- Linked subscriptions. User B "inherits" the subscriptions of User A. Every change in User A's subscription status is replicated to User B. One-to-many relationship to easen the transition.
- Front-end: Allow user to alter his account information
