- Affiliates. Links an affiliate to a coupon code and calculates the total commissions per term (e.g. per month)
- Resellers. A triangular sale: Reseller charges the user and uses our API to get a voucher (coupon) code. The user uses the coupon code on our site to subscribe. The reseller gets charged when the coupon is used.
- Linked subscriptions. User B "inherits" the subscriptions of User A. Every change in User A's subscription status is replicated to User B. One-to-many relationship to ease the transition.

================================================================================
On hold (I have to look into them more closely)
================================================================================
- Add/remove to SOBI2 (component handles its own payments; you can't do otherwise; need to ask Radek)
- Add/remove to SOBIPro (component handles its own payments; you can't do otherwise; need to ask Radek)

================================================================================
On ice (never going to happen)
================================================================================
- RokDownloads (it doesn't have a group system; please use JUGA)
- Add/remove to RedShop groups (I can't seem to be able to download the component)
- Payment: Authorize.net DirectPost <-- Their bloody license FORBIDS US to disseminate their API library to practically all EU countries. Including support for Authorize.NET makes distribution of our software illegal, so it's Not Going To Happen In This Lifetime. :(
+ Add/remove to Kunena groups (Kunena conflicts with the Nooku Framework)
