================================================================================
To-do / bug fixes:
================================================================================
# When a subscription is renewed, the old one MUST NOT send out expiration notification emails
# When a subscription is renewed, when the old subscription expires it MUST NOT send out an expiration email (or change the wording in the email)
+ Create invoices with ccInvoices
+ Add/remove to SOBIPro (Radek told me it's possible with groups)

================================================================================
Future ideas:
================================================================================
+ Add/remove to RedShop groups
+ SQL plugin, running a set of SQL commands, allowing for arbitrary integrations

+ Payment: Moneybookers http://www.moneybookers.com/app/help.pl?s=m_shoppingcart
+ Payment: PayPal Pro
+ Payment: DIBS
+ Add/remove to Agora groups

+ Add/remove to Mailchimp
- Add/remove to Jomres
- Payment: Eurobank (Greece)
- Payment: Amazon payments
- email class with multiple back-ends (PHP mail function, SMTP, sendmail, Amazon SES)
- Affiliates. Links an affiliate to a coupon code and calculates the total commissions per term (e.g. per month)
- Resellers. A triangular sale: Reseller charges the user and uses our API to get a voucher (coupon) code. The user uses the coupon code on our site to subscribe. The reseller gets charged when the coupon is used.
- Linked subscriptions. User B "inherits" the subscriptions of User A. Every change in User A's subscription status is replicated to User B. One-to-many relationship to ease the transition.
- Payment: PayPal recurring subscriptions
- Payment: Avangate http://www.avangate.com/ecommerce/

================================================================================
On hold (I have to look into them more closely)
================================================================================
+ Add/remove to Kunena groups (Kunena conflicts with the Nooku Framework - have to wait for 2.0)

================================================================================
On ice (never going to happen)
================================================================================
- RokDownloads (it doesn't have a group system; please use JUGA)
- Payment: Authorize.net DirectPost <-- Their bloody license FORBIDS US to disseminate their API library to practically all EU countries. Including support for Authorize.NET makes distribution of our software illegal, so it's Not Going To Happen In This Lifetime. :(
- Add/remove to SOBI2 (component handles its own payments)
