- PLUGIN system/asexpirationcontrol : Run a list of active subscriptions with expiration dates before today; Nooku does the rest. Store the last run date in component configuration plg_akeebasubs_asexpirationcontrol_timestamp. If we run out of time, set the timestamp to 0 so that we run on the next pageload.
- PLUGIN content/asrestricted : Content hding based on subscription settings; add option to emulate AMBRA.subscriptions feature
- Backend: allow running all integration plugins on all subscriptions (AJAX splitting required)
- PLUGIN akpayment/paypal : Paypal payment method (needs live testing)
- Backend: AMBRA.subscriptions import feature
- Front-end: Allow user to alter his account information
- PLUGIN akeebasubs/juga : Add/remove users from JUGA groups
