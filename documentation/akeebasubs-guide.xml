      <title>Introducing Akeeba Subscriptions</title>

      <bridgehead>At a glance</bridgehead>

      <para>Akeeba Subscriptions is a subscriptions management component for
      <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> 2.x/3.x and compatible distributions. It
      is built using our renowned Framework on Framework architecture which
      extends the standard Joomla! API, ensuring greater stability and
      compatibility across different Joomla! releases. It is licensed under
      the <link xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General
      Public License (GPL) version 3</link> or –at your option– any later
      version published by the Free Software Foundation. It licensing scheme
      means that you are free (and, in fact, more than welcome) to install it
      on as many sites as you want, whenever you want and use it for as long
      as you want, no strings attached. There are no secret per-domain
      licensing fees and you can use it to sell one or several millions of
      subscriptions without any hidden costs. We love Freedom of choice as
      much as you do!</para>

      <bridgehead>The killer features</bridgehead>

      <para>Its feature list is nothing short of amazing. Out of the box,
      Akeeba Subscriptions supports these features:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Streamlined administrator interface which can even present you
          an interactive sales graph and sales report as soon as you launch
          the component</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Rich subscription levels (subscription packages) editor which
          allows you to choose different images for each of your subscriptions
          and even a different order confirmation and order cancellation text
          to show to your users.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The easiest subscription management interface you've seen on a
          component. It will even show you your users' faces, powered by
          Gravatar.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Users can upgrade or expand (renew) their subscriptions.
          Renewing a subscription will create a new subscription which becomes
          valid the very second their old one expires. Users do not lose any
          of their subscription time when renewing, unlike most other
          subscription systems out there.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Full support for delayed payments, e.g. when using e-checks
          with PayPal.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Discount coupon codes which allow you to set an absolute money
          value or percentage discount for all or a specific subscription
          level and user, have publish up/publish down dates or a usage limit
          (e.g. the coupon code is valid only for the first 100 people to use
          it) – or a combination of any and all of the above!</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Automatic discounts for upgrading or renewing subscriptions
          based on the subscription level and days of presence in the
          subscription package. This allows you to easily create rules like:
          30% discount if you renew up to 30 days before the end of your
          subscription, 15% discount if you renew within the last 30 days, no
          discount otherwise.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Full support for complex tax calculations based on country,
          state and ZIP code. It fully integrates with the European Union's
          VIES system so that you can charge no VAT tax for intra-EU B2B
          transactions.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The subscription form can work with or without Javascript.
          With Javascript it becomes a fully fledged, auto-validating
          subscription form. Without Javascript it works as a standard web
          form, accessible to users who do not wish / cannot use Javascript on
          their browser.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Integration with Joomla! 1.6 and later user group
          mapping</para>
        </listitem>

          content only to registered subscribers, without the need of any
          external tool.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Payment methods: PayPal (for personal, verified and business
          accounts) is supported out of the box. Other payment methods are
          being added continuously. Over twenty of them are already
          implemented. Check out our documentation for more
          information.</para>

      <para>Please note that the software is provided free of charge, but
      support is not. You need to have an AKEEBADELUXE, SUPPORT or
      FORUMSUPPORT subscription on AkeebaBackup.com to seek support regarding
      setting up, using and customizing Akeeba Subscriptions. Please note that
      we can not help you with design requests or write customisation code for
      you. We can, however, help you by telling you what you have to do to
      accomplish your intended goal, e.g. which files to modify and pretty
      much a list of what you should do.</para>

      <title>Requirements and compatibility</title>

      <para>Akeeba Subscriptions 1.0.b4 and later will attempt to detect if
      your server meets the minimum requirements. If it does not, it will only
      do a partial installation (no plugins and modules will be installed) and
      you will be presented with an error message. In any case, Akeeba
      Subscriptions requires the following server-side configuration:</para>

        <bridgehead>Joomla! 1.6+ is logging you out during
        installation</bridgehead>

        <para>The first thing you might observe is that <emphasis
        role="bold">Joomla! 1.6 is logging you out when trying to
        install</emphasis> Akeeba Subscriptions. This is due to a bug in
        Joomla! 1.6. Please <link
        xlink:href="http://docs.joomla.org/Why_does_the_administrator_logoff_all_of_the_sudden">follow
        these instructions</link> to fix the database table that causes this
        issue. After doing that you will have to log in again to your site.
        You will see that everything is missing from the back-end interface.
        Don't panic! That's part of the Joomla! bug. Just log out using the
        link on the top-right of your page, then log back in. Everything is
        back to normal and you can retry the installation.</para>

        <bridgehead>Joomla! 1.6+ says "can't build admin menu" and
        fails</bridgehead>

        <note>
          <para>This problem should have gone away since Akeeba Subscriptions
          1.0.0 (Stable) and later releases</para>
        </note>

        <para>On some other occasions, especially when trying to install or
        update the component after an installation error, Joomla! will
        complain that it <emphasis role="bold">cannot build admin
        menus</emphasis>. This is due to another Joomla! 1.6/1.7 bug <link
        xlink:href="http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/joomla/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=25663">we
        have sent a patch for</link> to the Joomla! development team.
        Meanwhile, you will have to run a few SQL statements against your
        database with a database editor such as phpMyAdmin:</para>

        <programlisting>DELETE FROM jos_assets WHERE `name` = 'com_akeebasubs';
DELETE FROM jos_menu WHERE `menutype` = 'main' AND `alias` = 'com_akeebasubs';
DELETE FROM jos_extensions WHERE `type` = 'component' AND `element` = 'com_akeebasubs';</programlisting>

        <para>Remember to change <replaceable>jos_</replaceable> with your
        database tables' name prefix if you changed it during installation!
        It's easy to find out what it is. Take a look at the database and
        you'll see that all of your tables begin with the same few letters.
        That's your prefix. After running those SQL statements you can proceed
        with the reinstallation of the component.</para>

        <bridgehead>Checking your temporary directory</bridgehead>

        <para>First, we will have to make sure that you are using a valid
        temporary directory. Many sites are configured to use the system-wide
        (/tmp) directory or an invalid directory, causing installation
        problems. In order to change your site's temporary directory setting
        you have to follow this procedure, depending on your Joomla!
        version.</para>

            <para>Connect to your site using FileZilla. Navigate inside the

            <filename>www</filename> or something similar. If unsure don't ask
            us, ask your host. Now, on the right-hand pane you will find the
            FTP path. Most likely it will look something like
            <filename>/public_html</filename>. Copy this and paste it into the

        <bridgehead>Manual installation</bridgehead>

        <para>Sometimes <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> is unable to properly
        extract ZIP archives due to technical limitations on your server. In
        this case, you can follow a manual installation procedure.</para>

        <para>First, you have to extract the installation ZIP file in a
        subdirectory named <filename>akeeba</filename> on your local PC. Then,
        upload the entire subdirectory inside your site's temporary directory.
        At this point, there should be a subdirectory named
        <filename>akeeba</filename> inside your site's temporary directory
        which contains all of the ZIP package's files.</para>

        <para>If you are unsure where your site's temporary directory is
        located, you can look it up by going to the <guimenuitem>Global
        Configuration</guimenuitem>, click on the <guilabel>Server</guilabel>
        tab and take a look at the <guilabel>Path to Temp-folder</guilabel>
        setting. The default setting is the <filename>tmp</filename> directory

        <title>Updating to the latest release</title>

        <para>Akeeba Subscriptions can be updated with three different
        methods: installing the new version on top of the old one, using the
        integrated Live Update system or or using the extensions update
        feature in Joomla! 1.6 and later.</para>

        <bridgehead>Updating directly</bridgehead>

        <para>This is the failsafe approach, but the least convenient.
        Download the latest Akeeba Subscriptions release from <link
        xlink:href="https://www.AkeebaBackup.com/latest">https://www.AkeebaBackup.com/latest</link>
        and save the ZIP file to your hard disk. Log in to your site's
        backend, click on <guimenuitem>Extensions Manager</guimenuitem>
        (Joomla! 1.6 and later). Use the <guibutton>Browse...</guibutton>
        button to locate the ZIP file you downloaded, then click on
        <guibutton>Upload and Install</guibutton>. All Joomla! versions since
        1.5.5 are smart enough to understand that you're doing an upgrade
        instead of installation and adjust the process accordingly.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Do NOT uninstall Akeeba Subscriptions before updating it!
          Uninstalling will remove all of your data, including all subscriber
          information!</para>
        </important>

        <bridgehead>Using Live Update</bridgehead>

        <para>Since Akeeba Subscriptions 1.0.0 we have integrated our Live
        Update system inside Akeeba Subscriptions. Log in to your site's
        backend and go to <guimenu>Components</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Akeeba
        Subscriptions</guimenuitem>. Look towards the bottom of the page.
        There should be an icon which reads "Update found" when there is a new
        version available. Click on it and then click on "Update now". The new
        version will be downloaded and installed automatically for you. In
        case this doesn't work, or if "Live Update not supported" is displayed
        below the icon, please make sure that your host's firewall allows
        TCP/IP communications over port 80 and 443 to
        <uri>akeebabackup.com</uri> and <uri>s3.amazonaws.com</uri>. If your
        host requests IP addresses instead of domain names, please ask them to
        trace them from the server as they are multicast hostnames, which
        means that they resolve to a different IP depending on where in the
        world you are.</para>

        <bridgehead>Using Joomla! 1.6 and later's extension
        update</bridgehead>

        <para>Since Joomla! 1.6, the Joomla! Extensions Manager allows
        directly updating your extensions. Just log in to the backend of your
        site and go to <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Extension
        Manager</guimenuitem>. Click on the <guilabel>Update</guilabel> link
        below the toolbar. Then click on the <guibutton>Find
        Updates</guibutton> button. If there is a new Akeeba Subscriptions
        release it will appear in the list below. Tick the box on the left of
        the row and then click on the <guibutton>Update</guibutton> button. If
        your site is compatible with this Joomla! feature, you will see the
        new version being installed automatically for you.</para>

        <bridgehead>Something not working right after the update?</bridgehead>

        <para>Sometimes Joomla! "forgets" to copy all updated files. This is
        something that we have seen a few times. In this case, simply follow
        the instructions in the Updating Directly section above. This will
        force Joomla! to retry updating the component, copying the missing
        files and everything will work again.</para>

    <section xml:id="how-subscriptions-work">
      <title>How subscriptions work and Quick Start</title>

      <para>Before you begin setting up Akeeba Subscriptions, you should be
      aware of the way subscriptions work under the hood. The most basic
      concept is the subscription level (referred to simply as Level from now
      on). This is what you are selling to your customers. Your customers buy
      a subscription to a Level. The composite piece of information containing
      the Level, payment information and expiration time is called a
      Subscription.</para>

      <para>When a user enters the subscription page, Akeeba Subscriptions
      first fetches the price associated with the Level your user wants to
      buy. It will then try to understand if there is an applicable discount.
      First, it will look into Upgrade definitions and produce a list of
      upgrade rules applicable for the user and the Level he wishes to buy. If
      there are multiple applicable upgrade rules, the one giving the maximum
      discount is elected. Next up, it takes a look at the coupon code, is
      supplied. If it is an active coupon and your user can use it to get a
      discount, the coupon's discount is calculated. In the case where there
      are two discounts, both an upgrade discount and a coupon discount, the
      highest one is elected. The level price minus the discount is called the
      Net Price.</para>

      <para>Right up, Akeeba Subscriptions will try to determine the
      applicable tax by going through all the tax rules. It will go through
      the tax rules and keep the one which is the closest match to the
      country, zip code, city and VIES registration status. If no match is
      found, Akeeba Subscriptions will select the tax rate defined in the very
      first tax rule you have defined. This is called the Tax Amount. The sum
      of the Net Price and Tax Amount is the Gross Amount and that's what the
      user will have to pay.</para>

      <para>When the user hits the Subscribe button, Akeeba Subscriptions will
      first check if this is a new or existing user. If it is a new user, it
      will create a new –but inactive– user account based on the information
      the user has supplied. A new, inactive subscription will be created for
      your user and he's redirected to the payment gateway. Exception: if you
      have an 100% or more discount (which means that the user shall pay
      nothing) he's not redirected to the payment gateway. Instead, he's
      redirected to the Subscription Confirmation page and his subscription
      becomes instantly active.</para>

      <para>Once the user finishes the payment, he's redirected to the
      Subscription Confirmation page. If he changes his mind and cancels the
      payment, he will be taken to the Subscription Cancellation page. The
      text on each page is determined by the relevant fields in the Level
      configuration.</para>

      <para>At the same time, your payment processor will send a post-back to
      your site, notifying Akeeba Subscriptions about the payment status. If
      the payment is marked as complete, the subscription is activated. Its
      start and expiration date are calculated based on the exact date and
      time that the payment post-back was received and the Level's configured
      length. If the associated user account was marked as blocked (inactive),
      it is activated. If any integrations are set up, they will run. For
      example, you may be adding users to JUGA groups upon a successful
      subscription.</para>

      <para>Based on the above, you need to configure the following –in the
      order shown– for Akeeba Subscriptions to work:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Coupons - (optional) discount codes used for promotions</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Alternatively, you can import Subscription Levels and Coupons from
      other subscription systems instead of manually defining them.</para>

      <para>The sections below will tell you how to go through each of these
      steps.</para>

      <bridgehead>How to make it all work together to make money from your
      site</bridgehead>

      <para>What we described above cover just one small part of Akeeba
      Subscriptions' functionality: how to create something that your clients
      can buy and how to sell it. Obviously, your clients expect to get
      something for the money they paid. In other words, you need to make the
      subscriptions <emphasis>do something</emphasis> on your site. Akeeba
      Subscriptions' integration plugins are that magic glue which binds
      together subscriptions and features on your site.</para>

      <para>In order to make it easier to understand, let's take a simple
      example. Alice wants to set up a magazine site. Subscribers will have
      access to premium content. She wants to sell 3, 6 and 12 months
      subscriptions. How can she do it? Very easily, but she has to start
      <emphasis>backwards</emphasis>. She will set up her site's Joomla! ACL
      to limit access to the premium content, Akeeba Subscriptions to sell
      subscriptions to the premium content and the <guilabel>Akeeba
      Subscriptions - Joomla! Usergroups Integration</guilabel> plugin as the
      glue to link Joomla! ACL (usergroups) to subscriptions. Still with us?
      Let's see how she can do it in 5 minutes or less.</para>

      <para>First, she has to ensure that premium content can only be accessed
      by subscribers. Using Joomla! 1.6 and later it is very easy to do so.
      She needs to create a Joomla! user group called
      <option>Subscribers</option>. Then, she will create a new View Access
      Level called <option>Premium Content</option>, adding only the new
      Subscribers group to it. Then she will set the View Access Level to all
      her premium Joomla! articles to, you guessed it, Premium Content.</para>

      <para>Then, she will set up the three subscription levels. The first
      level is called <option>3MONTHS</option> and has a duration of 90 days.
      The second one is called <option>6MONTHS</option> and has a length of
      180 days. The last one is called <option>12MONTHS</option> and has a
      length of 365 days.</para>

      <para>Now she can limit who can access the premium content and she can
      sell subscriptions. It's time to glue things together, making sure that
      buying a subscription gives you access to the premium content. The logic
      is simple: you need to use the relevant Akeeba Subscriptions integration
      plugin. In our case, we want to glue together Akeeba Subscriptions and
      Joomla! user groups. Cool bananas! There's a plugin for that, it's
      called "Akeeba Subscriptions - Joomla! Usergroups Integration". First
      stop for Alice is the Extensions, Plugin Manager page where she finds
      the plugin and activates it. The plugin, however, is just your typical
      computer personality: dumb. You need to tell it what to do. Easy peasy.
      Click on it and the configuration page appears. After reading the fine
      documentation, Alice figure out that she needs to enter the following in
      the two text areas:</para>

      <programlisting>3MONTHS=Subscribers
6MONTHS=Subscribers
12MONTHS=Subscribers</programlisting>

      <para>Translation for everyone else. Each line "glues" one Subscription
      Level to one Joomla! User Group. Left hand side: the title of the
      Subscription Level, as you entered it in Akeeba Subscriptions. The right
      hand side: the name of the Joomla! user group, as you entered it in
      Joomla!'s user group management.</para>

      <para>One final detail left: handling user payments. Essentially, you
      need a payments processor that Akeeba Subscriptions can talk to and ask
      them to handle the gory details of payments. The easiest option is
      PayPal. Setting it up is very easy, indeed. Just go to PayPal and open a
      new account. Now go to your site's Plugin Manager, find the "Akeeba
      Subscriptions - PayPal integration" plugin, enable it and edit its
      configuration. All you need to do is enter your email address, the same
      one you used to open a PayPal account, into the Merchant ID or Email
      field. Save and close. Done!</para>

      <para>Now you get the idea of how subscriptions and site features glue
      together. You start by developing your site, limiting access to premium
      content using groups or whatever your components provide. Then create
      your Subscription Levels in Akeeba Subscriptions. Continue with enabling
      and configuring the respective Akeeba Subscriptions integration
      plugin(s), gluing subscriptions to your site features. Finally add the
      payment plugins you want and you're ready to start making some
      money.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>This is the tax rate (in percentage units) used ONLY for
            front-end display. We strongly advise against using this option
            unless you are obliged to for legal reasons.</para>

            <para>One of the problems faced by our users is that they have to
            display prices inclusive VAT, no matter if they have tax rules
            which define that no VAT tax will be applied in some cases. So far
            the only way to do that was editing Akeeba Subscriptions' files
            directly or doing template overrides. This option is here to
            eliminate that need.</para>

            <para>Please note that this value IS NOT taken into account when
            calculating the amount of money to charge to the subscriber. It
            only modifies the price displayed in the All Levels view.</para>

            <para>Example: Let's say you have a subscription level which costs
            10 EUR. You enter a "Tax rate for display" value of 19. The price
            of the subscription level will be listed as 11.90 EUR (that's 10
            EUR plus 19% VAT).</para>

      <bridgehead>Multi-lingual support</bridgehead>

      <para>Akeeba Subscriptions 2.0 and later are able support multi-lingual
      sites without the need of a third-party extension. This is done by using
      language code "merge tags" in the three last fields outlined above:
      short description, message to show after successful sign-up and message
      to show after sign-up cancellation. The merge tags in the text look like
      this:</para>

      <programlisting>[IFLANG en-GB]This is the English description[/IFLANG]
[IFLANG fr-FR]Ceci est la description française[/IFLANG]
[IFLANG de-DE]Diese ist die deutsche Beschreibung[/IFLANG]
[IFLANG el-GR]Αυτή είναι η Ελληνική περιγραφή[/IFLANG]</programlisting>

      <para>Essentially, you have to wrap your per-language text in
      <code>[IFLANG <replaceable>languageCode</replaceable>]</code> and
      <code>[/IFLANG]</code> merge tags. The languageCode you must use is the
      five letter language code used by Joomla!'s translation packages. For
      example, the English language is en-GB (British English), en-AU
      (Australian English) or en-US (Unites States English), German is de-DE
      (Germany) or de-AT (Austria) and so forth. If you're unsure, please go
      to your site's back-end, Language Manager and take a look at the
      language code in there.</para>

      <para>Please note that you cannot use the same language code
      twice.</para>

      <bridgehead>Customising the messages to show on successful sign-up and

      <para>Since Akeeba Subscriptions 2.0.a3, you can personalise the
      messages which are shown after a successful sign-up or cancellation of
      the subscription process. This is done using "merge codes". The merge
      codes are explained below. Please note that you can use them in
      conjunction with Joomla! content plugins as well. In fact, using the
      merge codes you are open to a world of possibilities, even integrating
      an external affiliate system –like OSI Affiliates– on your site.</para>

      <title>Tax Rules</title>

      <para>You can access this feature by clicking on <guilabel>Tax
      Rules</guilabel> in the toolbar links area.</para>

      <para>Out of the box, Akeeba Subscriptions is set up to not apply any
      VAT or other tax at all. However, this is not what most users would
      like. Below we are providing the most common setups based on your
      business type. Our lawyers told us that we have to say this to you:
      Please note that we are not lawyers or tax technicians. As a result, our
      advice is based on our personal experience, may be flawed and in no way
      should be considered a legal or financial advice. Should you chose to
      use it you do so at your own risk. We strongly advise you to ask a
      qualified tax technician, lawyer or other relevant professional
      qualified by law to give you advice regarding tax laws. That said,
      here's the most common tax setups:</para>

      <bridgehead>Extra-EU businesses, e.g. US based</bridgehead>

      <para>Tax Rules determine if the user should be charged a tax amount on
      top of the regular price of the subscription level. If you do not wish
      to charge any taxes (e.g. you have already included any applicable taxes
      in your subscription price), you will still have to create a default
      rule with 0 tax charges. In order to do so, click on the New button,
      select the "- Select -" option in the Country drop-down and set the tax
      rate to 0, then click on Save. Now you have created a catch-all rule
      with 0% tax. Likewise, if you want to charge all users a flat tax rate,
      say 18%, do the same thing, but set the tax rate to your desired
      percentage, in our case 18 (note: without the % sign!) and click on
      Save.</para>

      <bridgehead>Intra-EU businesses with a VIES registered VAT number, or
      extra-EU businesses with an EU VAT number</bridgehead>

      <para>If you are a business based in the European Union with a
      VIES-registered VAT number you have to create a total of 30 rules to
      conform to the overcomplicated EU tax regulations. First, create a
      default rule with 0% tax as noted above. Then do the same thing, but set
      the <guilabel>VIES Reg</guilabel> option to Yes and the tax rate to 0%.
      Now create new tax rules for each one of these countries, <guilabel>VIES
      Reg</guilabel> set to No and tax rate set to your local VAT tax rate
      (e.g. 23% for Greece): Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech
      Republic, Germany, Greece, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary,
      Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands,
      Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United
      Kingdom. For the country of your business (e.g. Greece for a
      Greece-based business) create on more rule with <guilabel>VIES
      Reg</guilabel> set to Yes and the tax rate set to your local VAT tax
      rate (e.g. 23% for Greece).</para>

      <para>After setting up the tax rules you need to pay attention to the
      ordering of the rules. The correct ordering of the rules is:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The first published rule must be the catch-all default rule
          for EU countries: no country selected, VIES Reg set to Yes, tax rate
          set to 0.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The second published rule must be the catch-all default rule
          for non-EU countries: no country selected, VIES Reg set to No, tax
          rate set to 0.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The following rules, in any order, are the tax rules for each
          EU country except yours: VIES Reg set to Yes and tax rate set to
          0</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Finally, publish the two rules for your country:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>One rule where VIES Reg is set to Yes and tax set to your
              local VAT rate</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>One more rule where VIES Reg is set to No and tax set to
              your local VAT rate</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>This way, the following happens:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If the customer is extra-EU he will be charged no VAT (the
          first catch-all rule kicks in)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If the customer is intra-EU, but not a business with a
          VIES-registered VAT number, he's paying VAT (the second catch-all
          rule kicks in).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If the customer is an intra-EU business, he will be charged no
          VAT (the specific country rule kicks in). He's liable to VAT on his
          local tax authorities, not your country's tax authorities.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If the customer is from your own country, you are charging him
          with VAT no matter of the VIES registration status (the final two
          rules kick in).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Do note that the same setup is required if you are an extra-EU
      business –e.g. US-based– with an EU VAT ID (it's in the format
      EU012345678). In this case, you have no EU country of residence, so you
      can skip the last set of two tax rules mentioned above.</para>

      <bridgehead>Intra-EU businesses without a VIES-registered VAT
      number</bridgehead>

      <para>Please ask your lawyer whether it's legal for you to sell
      subscriptions to residents of a country other than yours. There is a gap
      in the EU directives regarding that case, therefore we can't provide you
      with even semi-accurate tax setup information within any stretch of
      imagination.</para>

      <bridgehead>Tax Rule options</bridgehead>

      <para>Each tax rule has the following options:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Country</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Which country this tax rule is applicable in. If empty (the

            <para>Which city this tax rule is applicable in. Do note that the
            spelling of the city must match, but it's case insensitive. This
            means that <option>new york</option>, <option>NEW YORK</option>
            and <option>New York</option> are equivalent. Leave blank to match
            all cities.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>VIES Reg</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>If set to Yes, the tax rule matches only those clients with
            a valid, VIES registered EU VAT number. If you don't know what

            <para>The tax rate percentage. If you need to enter decimal
            digits, use a dot not a comma. For example, <option>17.5</option>
            is valid, <option>17,5</option> is INVALID. Do NOT type the
            percentage sign. For example, <option>23</option> is valid,
            <option>23%</option> is INVALID. The percentage is always implied,
            that's why it's printed after the field's contents.</para>

            <para>A special type, available since version 2.2, is the "Percent

          <listitem>
            <para>The final discount is normally defined by the upgrade rule
            that generates the highest discount. When upgrade rules have the
            <guilabel>Combine</guilabel> option set to <option>Yes</option>,
            then all these (that apply to the subscriber's situation) will be
            added together (combined) to define the discount. In other words,
            the applicable upgrade rules with the Combined flag turned on work
            accumulatively instead of exclusively. This feature comes in handy
            when you want to give discounts to "bundle" subscriptions, i.e.
            subscription levels which give you the same privileges as buying
            several other subscription levels at the same time.</para>

            <para>Example #1 (without Combine):</para>

            <programlisting>Rule A gives $ 10 discount
Rule B gives $ 15 discount
Rule C gives $ 20 discount</programlisting>

            <para>Total discount will be $20 given by rule C because it's the

      <para>Practical examples of upgrade rules:</para>

      <para>You want to give a 30% discount to users with a SUB1 annual
      subscription if they renew up to 30 days before their subscription
      expiration. Both levels set to SUB1, min presence is set to 0, max
      presence is set to 335 (one year is 365 days, minus 30 days, equals 335
      days), discount type Percent, value 30.</para>

      <para>You want to give a 15% discount to users with a SUB1 annual
      subscription if they renew during the last 30 days of their
      subscription. Both levels set to SUB1, min presence is set to 335 (one
      year is 365 days, minus 30 days, equals 335 days), max presence set to
      365 (one full year) discount type Percent, value 15.</para>

      <para>You want to give a 10 Euro discount to users with a SUB1 annual
      subscription who are now buying a SUB2 subscription. From Level set to
      SUB1, To Level set to SUB2, min presence set to 0, max presence set to
      365 (one year), discount set to Value, value set to 10.</para>

      <para>You want users buying both SUB1 and SUB2 to have a 10 Euro
      discount. First, create a rule like in the previous example. Then create
      another rule with From Level set to SUB2, To Level set to SUB1, min
      presence set to 0, max presence set to 365, discount set to Value, value
      set to 10. This way, whichever subscription they buy first, they'll get
      the discount when they buy the other subscription as well.</para>

      <para>You want to give a complimentary (free) SUB3 subscription to users
      who have already bought SUB1 and SUB2: you can't do that with Upgrade
      Rules, as you cannot combine multiple subscriptions in a single rule.
      Instead, use a coupon code with 100% discount and show this coupon code
      only to subscribers who have already bought a SUB1 and SUB2 subscription
      using the Restricted Content plugin bundled with Akeeba
      Subscriptions.</para>

      <title>Coupons</title>

      <para>You can access this feature by clicking on
      <guilabel>Coupons</guilabel> in the toolbar links area.</para>

      <para>This feature allows you to create discount coupon codes. When a
      user enters a valid coupon code during registration, it's subtracted
      from the price of his subscription. You can let coupons work on specific
      subscriptions, specific users, for a predefined time period or even for
      a predefined number of times before becoming inactive. You can even
      create 100% discount coupons for giveaways or other similar promotional
      reasons.</para>

      <note>
        <para>You can not publish/unpublish coupons. A coupon will be
        automatically published when the current date is between its Valid
        From / Valid To dates. Likewise, a coupon will be automatically
        unpublished when the current date is outside its Valid From / Valid To
        dates. In order to unpublish a coupon set its Valid To date in the
        past and it will be automatically unpublished.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>The coupon code which the user has to enter in order to
            receive the discount. Very important: coupon codes are case
            insensitive, therefore it's best to type them in all capital
            letters. Moreover, we suggest using only capital Latin letters
            without accents or diacretics and numbers, so that all users can
            type them in using their keyboard.</para>

            conjunction with the Value field below. For example, if you are
            using Euros as your currency, you set Value here and type in a
            value of 10, the coupon gives 10 Euro discount.</para>

              "Completed" then the subscription is forced to be active within
              the time period defined by the valid from / to columns. If you

      <para>You can use the <guibutton>Run Integrations</guibutton> button any

      plugin or you just imported a large number of subscriptions.</para>

      <para>Using the <guibutton>Export to CSV</guibutton> button allows you

      OpenOffice.org Calc. Do note that the full set of raw data is dumped to
      the CSV file. What we mean is that the filters are applied, but instead
      of exporting just one page of data (what is displayed on your screen) it
      will export all pages of data.</para>

      <title>Affiliates management</title>

      <para>Since Akeeba Subscriptions 2.0.b1 there is a very basic affiliate
      management system. It is extremely (even stupidly!) simple by design. If
      you want something more complex, you can easily integrate Akeeba
      Subscriptions with a web-based affiliate management system, like OSI
      Affiliates.</para>

      <important>
        <para>We also ship plugins which allow you to integrate Akeeba
        Subscriptions with third party affiliate management solutions. Please
        take a look at the integration plugins section of our
        documentation.</para>
      </important>

      <para>The concept of affiliates in Akeeba Subscriptions is based on some
      simple rules:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>You manually create affiliates in the back-end of the

          <para>Each affiliate is linked to a Joomla! user account and is
          assigned a commission percentage</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>When you pay your affiliate, you manually create an affiliate
          payment record to let Akeeba Subscriptions know how much you paid
          him and when</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Each subscription with a payment status of C (Completed)
          counts towards the amount owed to the affiliate</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Each affiliate payment deducts from the amount owed to the

          <para>There is no "affiliate report" page of any kind</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>It's an extremely simple system, suitable for small sites with a
      handful of trusted affiliates. If you're interested in integrating a
      much more powerful third party affiliate system, please contact our
      support.</para>

      <bridgehead>How to use affiliates?</bridgehead>

      <para>Each affiliate has a unique numeric Affiliate ID. You can see that
      in the left-hand column in the affiliates management page. For our
      example, we'll assume that our affiliate has an ID of 123.</para>

      <para>In order for a sale to be registered to that affiliate, you need
      to redirect the prospective buyer to the subscription levels list page,
      having appended the <uri>affid=<replaceable>123</replaceable></uri> URL
      parameter at the end of the URL. For example, if your subscription level
      list page's URL is <uri>http://www.example.com/subscribe.html</uri> and
      your Affiliate ID is 123 then all visitors must visit the URL
      <uri>http://www.example.com/subscribe.html?affid=123</uri> for the sale
      to be registered to the affiliate. If you're not using SEF URLs with
      Joomla!, the URL would be something like
      <uri>http://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_akeebasubs&amp;view=levels&amp;affid=123</uri>
      instead.</para>

      <para>The prospective buyer is free to wander off to other pages of your
      site freely before coming buying his subscription. The affiliate ID is
      stored in the user's session. As long as he has activated cookies on his
      browser (it's on by default on all browsers) then the affiliate ID will
      be "remembered" throughout the user's session.</para>

      <para>The subscription page defines two module positions where you can
      publish modules to further expand the information presented on the page.
      Publishing modules in the <option>akeebasubscriptionsheader</option>
      position will make them appear at the very top of the page, right above
      the Steps bar. That's a good place to publish information about SSL
      security or banners about your latest special offers. Publishing modules
      in the <option>akeebasubscriptionsfooter</option> position will make
      them appear right after the end of the subscription form. This is a good
      place to put a custom HTML module with links to your terms of service,
      business contact information, etc.</para>

      <para>Additionally, the page which lists the subscriptions defines
      another two module positions where you can publish modules to further
      expand the information presented on the page. Publishing modules in the
      <option>akeebasubscriptionslistheader</option> position will make them
      appear at the very top of the page, right above the list of subscription
      levels. Publishing modules in the
      <option>akeebasubscriptionslistfooter</option> position will make them
      appear right after the end of the subscription levels list.</para>

        <para>You need to publish the "Akeeba Subscriptions - Custom fields"

      </important>

      <para>One of the most frequently requested features in Akeeba
      Subscriptions has been the customisation of the fields shown in the
      subscription page. Traditionally, this has been possible only by
      creating specialised Joomla! plugins. For all the merits of custom
      plugins, there was always one major drawback: it takes a developer to
      create them, making it impossible for non-developer site owners and
      integrators to add custom fields. Not any more! The Custom Fields
      feature of Akeeba Subscriptions allows you to easily create simple
      fields, such as text boxes and selection lists, using a simple graphical
      user interface. The custom fields are stored per user and shown in
      Akeeba Subscriptions' <guilabel>Users</guilabel> page.</para>

      <para>You can access this feature by clicking on the Custom Fields
      toolbar link.</para>

        <bridgehead>Subscription Levels</bridgehead>

        <para>You can use custom field data in a Subscription Level's sign-up

        my_field you can use the merge tag <option>[CUSTOM:MY_FIELD]</option>

          translation much easier as the key name provides
          <emphasis>context</emphasis> to your translators, e.g. it tells them
          that they are translating the field title for such and such user
          defined custom field in Akeeba Subscriptions.</para>
        </tip>

        <para>And now, the interesting part: assigning a localised message per
        language constant and site language. Using Joomla! 2.5 and later it is
        easy, using its <guilabel>Language Override</guilabel> feature. Log
        into your site's back-end and go to <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>,
        <guisubmenu>Language Manager</guisubmenu>, then click on
        <guimenuitem>Overrides</guimenuitem>. Right above the list, on the
        right-hand side, there is a drop down. Select your desired language,
        e.g. <guilabel>English (United Kingdom) - Site</guilabel>.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Make sure you select the "- Site" variant of your
          language.</para>
        </important>

        <para>Click on the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button. In the new page,
        type the language constant in the <guilabel>Language
        constant</guilabel> field. Then enter the translation in the
        <guilabel>Text</guilabel> field. Then make sure you tick the
        <guilabel>For both locations</guilabel> checkbox. Finally click on the
        <guibutton>Save &amp; Close</guibutton> button to save your language
        override. Repeat those steps for each language on your site and your
        fields' labels will be localised.</para>

      <title>Customising Akeeba Subscriptions</title>

      <para>The author has no illusions about being any good as a web
      designer. The opposite is true. To this end, we've made it very easy for
      users to override the CSS files of Akeeba Subscriptions in their
      templates. The following sections will explain how to customise Akeeba
      Subscriptions' front-end display.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Customising the front-end layout</title>

        <para>Layout customisation usually involves either changing just the
        CSS or changing both the CSS and HTML output of the component. Both
        can be accomplished with template overrides. We will explain the two
        procedures below.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Newer versions of the component may introduce changes to the
          base CSS files and HTML output. We recommend you to review your
          overridden files every time you upgrade Akeeba Subscriptions. We
          regret to inform you that we can not accept bug reports and support
          requests unless the issues you have can be reproduced <emphasis>even
          after disabling your overrides</emphasis>.</para>
        </warning>

        <procedure>
          <step>
            <para>Find your current template's subdirectory in your site's
            root, under the <filename>tempates</filename> directory. In this
            example, we will assume it is
            <filename>templates/<replaceable>mytemplate</replaceable></filename></para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>Create a new directory

            <filename>templates/<replaceable>mytemplate</replaceable>/media/com_akeebasubs/css</filename>
            directory. From now on, Akeeba Subscription will load this new
            <filename>frontend.css</filename> file instead of the file found
            under <filename>media/com_akeebasubs/css</filename>.</para>

        </procedure>

        <para>Please don't ask us for CSS or design ideas. We are good
        developers and horrid designers. You can ask us, however, regarding
        any issues you might experience overriding our CSS files.</para>

        <bridgehead>Customising the HTML output</bridgehead>

        <para>Sometimes it's not enough modifying the CSS. In order to achieve
        your desired styling you may also have to add some extra div or span
        elements in the HTML output. When this happens you need to perform
        template overrides for our view template PHP files, a process called
        Template Overrides in Joomla! jargon. Instead of reinventing the wheel
        by writing lengthy instructions, we think it's better for you to read
        the <link

    <para>Akeeba Subscriptions is designed to be a modular system, powered by
    standard Joomla! plugins. Using plugins you can add payment methods as

    subscription or email reminders for subscription expiration) is take care

        <bridgehead>Recurring payments support notes</bridgehead>

        <para>PayPal has some restrictions regarding the renewal period of
        subscription. A subscription may recur in a period of 1-90 days, 1-52
        weeks, 1-24 months or 1-5 years. Akeeba Subscriptions will
        automatically convert the subscription duration to the closest match.
        This may not always be what you expect. For example, 180 days is
        converted to 6 months and 15 days is converted to 2 weeks. Due to the
        fuzziness of the conversion and the way PayPal handles renewals, it is
        possible that a subscription will expire before it is automatically
        renewed. If a subscription expires, an expiration email will be sent
        to your client.</para>

        <para>Payments will recur till the end of the world unless you cancel
        your PayPal account, your client cancels his PayPal account, your
        client manually unsubscribes from his PayPal account's back-end or
        your client does not have funds for 3 consecutive days after his
        renewal is due. In all of the above cases, your client's subscription
        may expire before it is renewed. If a subscription expires, an
        expiration email will be sent to your client.</para>

        <para>You can not cancel recurring payments through Akeeba
        Subscriptions. You have to do so manually, from PayPal's
        back-end.</para>

        <para>When a subscription payment recurs, the original subscription
        record is overwritten. In order for you not to lose statistics
        information, a new <emphasis role="bold">expired</emphasis>
        subscription record is created with the old subscription record's
        information. This means that the subscription with the biggest
        subscription ID (appearing towards the top of the front- and back-end
        lists) will show as expired. This is not a bug. PayPal sends us the
        original subscription's ID as a reference, which is why only the
        original subscription can be updated.</para>

        <bridgehead>Integration notes</bridgehead>

        <para>PayPal doesn't handle UTF-8 data very gracefully by default. You
        will have to enable UTF-8 on your PayPal account to let accented and
        international characters be accepted in the payment pages.</para>

        <para>This is a payment plugin which lets your users complete their
        payment off-line, e.g. through bank (wire) transfer, money check,
        Western Union or any other means of payment that you allow. It works
        very simply: it just presents your user with a customizable
        instructions message. In that message you can use the variables
        <replaceable>{SUBSCRIPTION}</replaceable> to display the subscription
        ID and <replaceable>{AMOUNT}</replaceable> to display the amount due.
        You can also use <replaceable>{FIRSTNAME}</replaceable> and
        <replaceable>{LASTNAME}</replaceable> for the user's first and last
        name, respectively. Please use all caps for these variables and
        include the curly braces.</para>

          <para>The text in this field is HTML code. If you want to add
          linebreaks, just add a &lt;br/&gt; tag. Of course you can use any
          kind of HTML markup you wish, such as &lt;b&gt; for bold text, or
          even embed a Flash file (even though I can't possibly think
          <emphasis>why</emphasis> you'd want to do <emphasis>that</emphasis>)
          as long as it's allowed by your Joomla! version and preferences.
          It's safe to assume that basic HTML like &lt;p&gt;, &lt;em&gt;,
          &lt;b&gt; and &lt;a&gt; tags will work.</para>

        <note>
          <para>The following notes were shared with us by our clients. We
          include them here in hope that it will help you setting up the
          payment plugin. We have not been able to verify them ourselves in
          any other way except checking with our users that the payment plugin
          works for them.</para>
        </note>

        <para>The ccAvenue documentation can be quite confusing. ccAvenue has
        three different transaction type options to choose from. In order to
        use Akeeba Subscriptions with ccAvenue, you have to select the first
        transaction type option (variable amount) in ccAvenue's
        interface.</para>

        <para>Moreover, some users report that you have to deactivate the
        Working Key if it's activated.</para>

        <para>You will have to give some URLs to Alpha Bank before going
        live.</para>

        <para>The first one is the "Payment page". Unfortunately, this can not
        be provided, as the referrer page (where the client performs the
        payment from) depends on your menu structure and the subscription
        level your user buys. If they insist, give them this URL:</para>

        <para><uri>http://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_akeebasubs&amp;view=subscribe</uri></para>

        <para>Where www.example.com is the domain name of your site. If this
        doesn't work and ask you to contact your web developer to change the
        payment system, we regret to inform you that this IS NOT AN OPTION.
        Besides, the bank checking the HTTP referer field for "security
        reasons" (as they say in their documentation) is stupid. This HTTP
        field can be forged very easily or even turned off (ref. <link
        xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec15.html">RFC
        2616 ch. 15.1.2 §7</link>) and must not be used for security purposes.
        Moreover, not allowing more than one payment URLs is unheard of in
        this decade. Please ask the bank to fix their system. After all, it's
        YOUR money on the line.</para>

        <para>The other three URLs they require are the Success, Failure and
        Cancel pages. For all of them give them this URL:</para>

        <para><uri>http://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_akeebasubs&amp;view=callback&amp;paymentmethod=deltapay</uri></para>

        <para>where www.example.com must be replaced with the domain name of
        your site.</para>

        methof. Moneris offers is the largest payment processor in Canada and
        offers its services even to non-Canadian businesses. The eSelect plus
        method is a hosted payments solution, which means that your site
        needn't have an SSL certificate, as your users are not entering their
        credit card information directly on your site, but on a Moneris-hosted

        <para>If you want to set up multiple levels, you can enter one level

        <para>We are not through yet. We also need to enter the API keys. Go

        the API Key and API Secret Key. Copy those keys to Akeeba
        Subscriptions plugin's same-named fields. Now save the plugin, publish
        it and you're ready to start selling.</para>

        <para>There are two ways to confirm the payments made by your clients
        and activate subscriptions, the manual method and the automatic
        method.</para>

        <para>In the manual method you have to check for IFthen payments
        daily. Then you must go to your Subscriptions view, find the
        subscriptions which have been paid for an enable them by setting the
        payment status to "Completed". Please note that the IFthen reference
        number is displayed in the Processor Key field.</para>

        <para>The second method is an automatic call-back made by IFthen to
        your site when each payment is completed. This will allow Akeeba
        Subscriptions to enable paid subscriptions automatically. In order to
        use that you have to send an email to IFthen asking them to enable
        callbacks. In the email, you need to provide two pieces of
        information:</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The callback URL which is

      <title>Integration with third party software</title>

      <para>One of the most important aspects about subscription systems is
      their ability to integrate with third party software. A subscription all
      by itself means pretty much nothing. It's just a "flag". The added value
      is when this subscription allows the user holding it to actually do
      something on the site. At this point in time, there are only a handful
      of integrations. If you are interested in more integrations let us know
      and we'll add them to our implementation to-do list.</para>

      <para>All integrations with third party applications are standard
      Joomla! plugins, published in the <option>akeebasubs</option>

        <para>This integration plugin allows you to add and remove users from

        it allows you to automatically authorize subscribers and deauthorize

        access to your Community Builder community based on their subscription
        status.</para>

        <para>Please note that this is a smart integration, exactly as
        described in the JUGA plugin in this documentation; instead of adding
        users when a subscription goes active and removing them when a
        subscription goes inactive, Akeeba Subscriptions plugins take a look
        at all of the user's active and inactive subscriptions and decide if

        <warning>
          <para>This integration has only been tested against DOCman 1.5.
          DOCman 2.0 and later uses Joomla! 1.6 and later's user groups and
          ACLs to control who can download what. You are advised to use the
          Joomla! 1.6 user group integration plugin instead of the DOCman
          integration plugin with DOCman 2.0 and later.</para>
        </warning>

        <para>This integration plugin allows you to add and remove users from
        DOCman groups based on their subscription status. This allows you to

            <listitem>
              <para>This is a list for assigning subscription levels to DOCman
              groups. When a user has an active subscription to the specified
              level, he'll be added to the DOCman group mentioned on the right

              <programlisting>LEVEL1=Group 1,Group 2,Group 3</programlisting>

              <para>Where LEVEL1 is the Title of the subscription level and
              Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 are the names of the DOCman groups

              <para>You can also use the numeric IDs of subscription levels or

        <para>This integration plugin allows you to add and remove users from
        JomSocial groups based on their subscription status. This allows you
        to control access to your JomSocial groups based on a user's
        subscription status.</para>

        <para>Please note that this is a smart integration; instead of adding
        users when a subscription goes active and removing them when a
        subscription goes inactive, Akeeba Subscriptions plugins take a look
        at all of the user's active and inactive subscriptions and decide
        which groups the user should be added to or removed from.</para>

        <para>The plugin has these options:</para>

        <variablelist>

            <term>Add to JomSocial groups</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>This is a list for assigning subscription levels to
              JomSocial groups. When a user has an active subscription to the
              specified level, he'll be added to the JomSocial group mentioned
              on the right hand of the equal sign. Each assignment is done
              like this:</para>

              <programlisting>LEVEL1=Group 1,Group 2,Group 3</programlisting>

              <para>Where LEVEL1 is the Title of the subscription level and
              Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 are the names of the JomSocial
              groups you want to add a user to when he subscribes. If you want
              to assign multiple subscription levels to multiple groups, you
              have to do something like that (separate multiple lines with a
              single press of the ENTER key on your keyboard):</para>

              <programlisting>LEVEL1=Group 1,Group 2,Group 3
LEVEL2=Group 2
LEVEL3=Group 4,Group 1</programlisting>

              <para>You can also use the numeric IDs of subscription levels or
              JomSocial groups instead of their titles. However, we consider
              working with numeric IDs very counter-intuitive.</para>

              remove a user from when his subscription to the specified level
              is no longer active. Do note that you can specify a different
              set of groups to remove the user from than the ones you are
              adding him to. For example:</para>

              <programlisting>LEVEL1=Group 1,Group 2
LEVEL2=Group 2
LEVEL3=Group 1</programlisting>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        <para>In this example, together with the rules displayed in "Add to
        JomSocial groups", when a subscription to the LEVEL1 level expires,
        the user will still belong to JomSocial Group 3, as it's not removed
        from his account; only Group 1 and Group 2 are removed. Likewise, if
        the user has an expired LEVEL1 subscription and an active LEVEL2
        subscription he'll now belong to Group 2 and Group 3: Group 3 because
        it's not removed when his subscription expires and Group 2 because his
        active LEVEL2 subscription suggests that he should be granted Group 2
        access despite his expired LEVEL1 subscription.</para>

        <para>Since Akeeba Subscriptions 1.0.0 it is possible to have plugins
        which can override user information (e.g. name, address) and can also
        be notified when user's information is being saved. This allows for
        very advanced integrations. One possibility is to automatically fetch
        such information from external services and component, e.g. using a
        geolocation service or fetching user information from Community
        Builder, JomSocial, etc. The other possibility is to provide a
        "reverse integration", e.g. update Community Builder or JomSocial
        fields based on the information the user entered in the subscription
        page, essentially making the user believe that all of his information
        is managed in a single place.</para>

        <para>This particular plugin acts as a demonstration of this plugin
        system. It will query the user's IP address against the free

        <para>Displayed in the Plugins Manager as: <guilabel>Akeeba
        Subscriptions - Custom SQL scripts</guilabel></para>

        <para>This plugin can run arbitrary SQL commands when a subscription
        becomes active or inactive. Please note that this plugin is very
        naive. For starters, it will run the SQL commands once for every
        active and inactive subscriptions it encounters. If you have two
        disabled subscriptions and five enabled subscriptions on a specific
        level it will run the deactivation SQL twice and the activation SQL
        five times. Moreover, the plugin fires: when a new subscription is
        created; when the subscription status changes for any reason (payment
        status changes, manual disable/enable, automatic enable/disable due to
        Valid From/To dates being reached) and when you click on the Run
        Integration button.</para>

        <para>In the plugin's parameters you can define the SQL commands to
        run. In all cases, you can do something like this:</para>

        <programlisting>LEVEL1=INSERT INTO #__foobar (`user_id`,`something`) VALUES( '<replaceable>[USERID]</replaceable>', 'myvalue' );</programlisting>

        <para>The leftmost part is the subscription level for which the SQL
        command will run. The rightmost part is the list of SQL commands,
        separated by semicolons. The <replaceable>[USERID]</replaceable>
        variable will be replaced with the user's numeric ID for the user
        whose subscription Akeeba Subscriptions is currently processing. The
        [USERNAME] variable will be replaced with the user's username
        (available since Akeeba Subscriptions 2.1).</para>

        <para>Displayed in the Plugins Manager as: <guilabel>Akeeba
        Subscriptions - RedShop User Synchronisation</guilabel>. Available
        since Akeeba Subscriptions 2.0.1.</para>

        <para>This plugin provides two-way synchronisation between the user
        data stored in RedShop and Akeeba Subscriptions. Such data include the
        name of the user, email address, address data, business name and VAT
        number. When enabled, two things will happen:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>When a user enters the subscription page, the form will be
            pre-filled with his main RedShop address details, as long as he's
            logged in</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>When the user submits the subscription form, the main
            RedShop address of this user will be created/updated with the
            information he entered in the subscription form</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>This plugin WILL NOT magically synchronise data when it changes
        in RedShop. The synchronisation occurs ONLY when the user is visiting
        the subscription page to make a new subscription or "renew" an
        existing one (subscription renewal in Akeeba Subscriptions is the same
        thing as a new subscription).</para>

        <para>This integration plugin allows you to add and remove users from
        Kunena groups based on their subscription status. This allows you to
        fully utilize Kunena's built-in ACL capabilities.</para>

        <para>The plugin has these options:</para>

            <term>Add to Kunena groups</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>This is a list for assigning subscription levels to Kunena
              groups. When a user has an active subscription to the specified
              level, he'll be added to the Kunena group mentioned on the right
              hand of the equal sign. Each assignment is done like
              this:</para>

              <programlisting>LEVEL1=Group 1, Group 2</programlisting>

              <para>Where LEVEL1 is the Title of the subscription level and
              Group 1 and Group 2 are the names of the Kunena groups you want
              to add a user to when he subscribes (separate multiple groups
              with a comma). If you want to assign multiple subscription
              levels to multiple groups, you have to do something like that
              (separate multiple lines with a single press of the ENTER key on
              your keyboard):</para>

              <programlisting>LEVEL1=Group 1, Group 2
LEVEL2=Group 2
LEVEL3=Group 3, Group 4, Group 5</programlisting>

              <para>You can also use the numeric IDs of subscription levels or
              Kunena groups instead of their titles. However, we consider
              working with numeric IDs very counter-intuitive.</para>

        <para>In order to understand how this works, you have to consider the
        following cases:</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">The user has active subscriptions to
            one or more subscription levels listed in the plugin parameters
            (left hand side)</emphasis></para>

            <para>If the user does not have any Agent records, a new Company
            is created and the user becomes an Agent for that Company. The
            Company parameters are those defined in the right hand side of the
            plugin parameters (e.g. maxlistings=50,maxflistings=10 and so on).
            If you leave them blank, like in the LEVEL2 example above,
            Intellectual Property will use the default company
            parameters.</para>

            <para>If the user is already listed as an Agent to one or more
            companies, the company is published and the user's Agent record
            becomes published. This allows someone with an expired
            subscription to re-subscribe in order to regain access to his
            company. Furthermore, the parameters for each company for which he
            is listed as an agent are modified. The value chosen for each
            parameter is the maximum of the current parameter and the
            parameter value defined in the right hand part of the plugin's
            configuration. For example, if the company is configured with
            maxlistings=100 and the plugin configuration defines
            maxlistings=20, the company will continue to have maxlistings=100
            (maximum value wins). On the contrary, if the company is
            configured with maxlistings=10 and the plugin configuration
            defines maxlistings=20, the company will now have maxlistings=20
            (maximum value wins). Likewise, if the user is a subscriber to
            multiple subscription levels, the maximum value will be
            used.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">The user does not have active
            subscriptions to any of the subscription levels listed in the
            plugin parameters (left hand side)</emphasis></para>

            <para>All Agent records for this user become unpublished. This
            essentially revokes any administrative rights the user may have
            had on any of the companies for which he was listed as an
            Agent.</para>

            <para>Moreover, all of the companies the user was listed as an
            Agent are unpublished.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <bridgehead>How is this all supposed to work in real
        life?</bridgehead>

        <para>The flow is very simple: the user comes to your site and clicks
        the Subscribe menu item. He fills in his information and clicks on
        Subscribe Now. He's forwarded to the payment processor's page (e.g.
        PayPal) and pays. When his payment is cleared, the payment processor
        calls back your site. Akeeba Subscriptions handles the callback and
        enables the subscription. Enabling the subscription triggers the
        "Akeeba Subscriptions - Intellectual Property integration" plugin. The
        plugin adds the user as an Agent to IP. At the same time, the email
        plugin is triggered and send the user an email which tells him that
        his subscription is now activated. Your user can begin filing
        properties on your site.</para>

        <para>When a subscription expires and has not been renewed, the
        "Akeeba Subscriptions - Intellectual Property integration" plugin is
        triggered again. This time it removes the user from Intellectual
        Property. At the same time, the email plugin is triggered and send the
        user an email which tells him that his subscription has now expired.
        Your user can no longer file new or manage his existing properties on
        your site.</para>

        <para>The exact limits for the Intellectual Property agent are defined
        by the plugin's setup parameters. In the setup parameters you actually
        tell the plugin what are the limits imposed by each subscription
        level. You can have, for example, two levels. LEVEL1 can tell the
        plugin that the user can create up to 10 properties, LEVEL2 can tell
        the plugin that the user can create up to 20 properties. If the user
        subscribes only to LEVEL1 he will be able to create up to 10
        properties. If the user subscribes only to LEVEL2 he will be able to
        create up to 20 properties. If the user subscribes to both, he will be
        able to create up to 20 properties (the largest value wins, the values
        are not added).</para>

        <para>This integration plugin allows you to add and remove users from
        Agora Groups, with different Roles based on their subscription
        status.</para>

        <para>Please note that this is a smart integration; instead of adding
        users when a subscription goes active and removing them when a
        subscription goes inactive, Akeeba Subscriptions plugins take a look
        at all of the user's active and inactive subscriptions and decide
        which groups the user should be added to or removed from.</para>

        <para>Before we begin taking a look at the plugin options, please note
        that Agora defines Groups and Role. Each user can belong to one or
        more groups with a different Role, e.g. belong to Group One as a
        Guest, Group Two as a Member, Group Three as a Moderator and Group
        Four as an Administrator. Are you confused yet? Tell me about it...
        Unfortunately, we have to follow the same inconvenient structure for
        the plugin parameters. Each entry which can be assigned or removed
        from the user's record can therefore consist of a Group, or a Group
        and a Role. For example:</para>

        <para><programlisting>My Group</programlisting>defines an entry which
        only mentions a Group. The Role assigned to the user will be Member
        (it's a hardcoded default).</para>

        <programlisting>My Group/<replaceable>My Role</replaceable></programlisting>

        <para>defines an entry which defines a Group and a Role.
        <replaceable>My Role</replaceable> can be one of:</para>

        <para>Sometimes you will have a conflict. For example, a user may have
        two subscriptions. One subscriptions says that he should belong to
        Group One as a Member. The other says he should belong to Group One as
        a Moderator. In case of conflict, the highest Role wins. In our
        example, the user would become a Moderator in that group.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>This is a list for assigning subscription levels to Phoca
              Download categories. When a user has an active subscription to
              the specified level, he'll be added to the Phoca Download
              categories mentioned on the right hand of the equal sign. Each
              assignment is done like this:</para>

              <programlisting>LEVEL1=Group 1,Group 2,Group 3</programlisting>

              <para>Where LEVEL1 is the Title of the subscription level and
              Group 1, Group 2 and Group 3 are the names of the Phoca Download
              categories you want to add a user to when he subscribes. If you
              want to assign multiple subscription levels to multiple
              categories, you have to do something like that (separate
              multiple lines with a single press of the ENTER key on your

              <programlisting>LEVEL1=Group 1,Group 2,Group 3
LEVEL2=Group 2

              <para>You can also use the numeric IDs of subscription levels or
              Phoca Download categories instead of their titles. However, we

              categories to remove a user from when his subscription to the

              specify a different set of categories to remove the user from
              than the ones you are adding him to. For example:</para>

        <para>In this example, together with the rules displayed in "Add to
        Phoca Download groups", when a subscription to the LEVEL1 level
        expires, the user will still belong to Phoca Download category Group
        3, as it's not removed from his account; only categories Group 1 and
        Group 2 are removed. Likewise, if the user has an expired LEVEL1
        subscription and an active LEVEL2 subscription he'll now belong to
        categories Group 2 and Group 3: category Group 3 because it's not
        removed when his subscription expires and category Group 2 because his
        active LEVEL2 subscription suggests that he should be granted Group 2
        access despite his expired LEVEL1 subscription.</para>

        <para>If you want to customise the email messages, you can easily do
        so! First, you will need to find your language's language code. In
        order to do that, just take a look at administrator/language. You will
        see a lot of directories in there. en-GB is the English (United
        Kingdom) language and, depending on which languages you have installed
        on your site, you will see more directories e.g. es-ES for Spanish
        (Spain), de-DE for German (Germany), el-GR for Greek (Greece) and so
        on. Note that down. Whenever you see xx-XX below, replace it with your
        own language's language code.</para>

        <para>Go inside the <filename>administrator/language/xx-XX</filename>
        directory. Find the
        <filename>xx-XX.plg_akeebasubs_subscriptionemails.ini</filename> file
        and copy it to
        <filename>xx-XX.plg_akeebasubs_subscriptionemails.override.ini</filename>
        Now, edit any of the subscription email texts. The Emails plugin will
        use your override file instead of the default when sending out
        emails!</para>

        <note>
          <para>This plugin uses Joomla!'s mail system. You have to ensure
          that your site can send out emails (e.g. use the Mass Mail feature
          to send a test email to Super Administrators) before activating this
          plugin.</para>
        </note>

        <para>We strongly recommend publishing this plugin at all
        times.</para>

        <para>While creating the .override.ini translation files is a
        geek-friendly way of supplying custom email text, it is certainly not
        a user-friendly way. Most likely your clients have no idea what FTP
        is, making it impossible to trust them to find, create or edit INI
        files and upload them through FTP. Don't worry and don't despair!
        There's a Joomla! hidden secret called Language Overrides baked right
        into Joomla! 2.5 and later!</para>

        <para>Here's how to edit your emails text using Joomla! 2.5 and
        later's Language Override's feature. Log into your site's back-end and
        go to <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Language
        Manager</guimenuitem>, then click on <guilabel>Overrides</guilabel>.
        Right above the list, on the right-hand side, there is a drop down.
        Select your desired language, e.g. <option>English (United Kingdom) -
        Administrator</option>.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Make sure you select the "- Administrator" variant of your
          language. Counter-intuitively, plugin translation files are
          considered administrator language files.</para>
        </important>

        <para>Click on the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button. In the new page,
        in the right-hand side of the page, there is a search box. Enter a
        part of the email text you want to translate. For example, let's
        change the email header of a new (just-paid) subscription. We will
        search for <replaceable>new subscription</replaceable>. Make sure the
        radio button called <guilabel>Value</guilabel> is selected and click
        on <guibutton>Search</guibutton>. After 1-5 seconds, a list of
        matching language strings is shown below. You can use the
        <guilabel>More results</guilabel> link to load more language
        strings.</para>

        <para>The email language strings begin with
        <option>PLG_AKEEBASUBS_SUBSCRIPTIONEMAILS_</option>. In our case, we
        want to change the email header, so it is the
        <option>PLG_AKEEBASUBS_SUBSCRIPTIONEMAILS_HEAD_NEW_ACTIVE</option>
        option from the list. Click on it. Magically, the <guilabel>Language
        constant</guilabel> and <guilabel>Text</guilabel> fields on the
        left-hand side of the interface are populated.</para>

        <para>Brilliant! Now edit the text in the <guilabel>Text</guilabel>
        area to whatever you want. You can use the following variables in the
        text:</para>

        Subscriptions - Administrator Emails</guilabel></para>

        <para>When this plugin is published, an email will be sent out to the
        administrator (you can define the email address of the administrator)
        when any change in the status of a subscription has taken place. For a
        complete list of the events on which an email is sent you can take a
        look at the language file, e.g.
        <filename>administrator/language/en-GB/en-GB.plg_akeebasubs_afminemails.ini</filename>.
        Please note that if you are running a multilingual site, the site's
        active language at the time the subscription was registered is saved
        as the user's default language. As long as translation files for that
        language exist for our email plugin, then the emails the
        administrators will receive will be in that language (the default
        language of the user whose subscription has been modified).</para>

        <para>If you want to customise the email messages, you can easily do
        so! First, you will need to find your language's language code. In
        order to do that, just take a look at administrator/language. You will
        see a lot of directories in there. en-GB is the English (United
        Kingdom) language and, depending on which languages you have installed
        on your site, you will see more directories e.g. es-ES for Spanish
        (Spain), de-DE for German (Germany), el-GR for Greek (Greece) and so
        on. Note that down. Whenever you see xx-XX below, replace it with your
        own language's language code.</para>

        <para>Go inside the <filename>administrator/language/xx-XX</filename>
        directory. Find the
        <filename>xx-XX.plg_akeebasubs_adminemails.ini</filename> file and
        copy it to
        <filename>xx-XX.plg_akeebasubs_adminemails.override.ini</filename>
        Now, edit any of the subscription email texts. The Emails plugin will
        use your override file instead of the default when sending out
        emails!</para>

        <note>
          <para>This plugin uses Joomla!'s mail system. You have to ensure
          that your site can send out emails (e.g. use the Mass Mail feature
          to send a test email to Super Administrators) before activating this
          plugin.</para>

        <para>This content plugin allows you to show parts of your content

        <note>
          <para>The following documentation adds a space between the curly
          brackets ({ and }). This is done in order for Joomla! not to process
          the documentation text as plugin instructions. When you use the
          plugin, please DO NOT add a space between the curly braces and its
          contents. Thank you!</para>
        </note>

        <para>Its syntax is:</para>

        <programlisting>{ akeebasubs <replaceable>expression</replaceable> }Your content{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

        <para>This means that "Your content" will only be displayed to users
        whose subscriptions satisfy the <replaceable>expression</replaceable>.
        In the simplest form, expression is just the name of a subscription
        level, e.g.</para>

        <programlisting>{ akeebasubs LEVEL1 }Your content{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

        <para>If you want to present the content to someone who holds an
        active subscription to both LEVEL1 and LEVEL2, you can use the
        <option>&amp;&amp;</option> (logic and) operator:</para>

        <programlisting>{ akeebasubs LEVEL1 <option>&amp;&amp;</option> LEVEL2 }Your content{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

        <para>Likewise, you can use the || (logic or) operator to present the
        content to anyone who has a subscription to any of LEVEL3 or LEVEL4
        levels:</para>

        <programlisting>{ akeebasubs LEVEL3 <option>||</option> LEVEL4 }Your content{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

        <para>Important note: The logical OR consists of two "pipe" symbols.
        These are not the same as capital I! On a Mac's keyboard, the pipe
        symbol is present next to the ENTER key, accessible by pressing
        SHIFT-\. On most Windows/Linux machines, this key is usually somewhere
        near the ENTER key and is most likely accessible by pressing SHIFT-\
        as well.</para>

        <para>You can also negate the logic. For example, you can present the
        content to anyone having a subscription to neither LEVEL1 nor LEVEL3
        by using the ! (logical not) operator:</para>

        <programlisting>{ akeebasubs !LEVEL1 &amp;&amp; !LEVEL3 }Your content{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

        <para>If you specify multiple operators, the precedence is NOT, AND,
        OR. This means that the exclamation mark is processed first, the
        ampersands second and the bars last. Example:</para>

        <programlisting>{ akeebasubs !LEVEL1 || LEVEL2 &amp;&amp; !LEVEL3 }Your content{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

        <para>This means that the content will be presented to users who do
        not have a subscription to LEVEL1. Also, if they do have a LEVEL1
        subscription and they are also LEVEL2 (but not LEVEL3) subscribers the
        content will also be shown to them.</para>

        <tip>
          <para>Since Akeeba Subscriptions 1.0 Stable you can also use a
          pseudo-level marked by a single star (*) which matches all active
          subscriptions. For example, to show something to all subscribers
          use:</para>

          <programlisting>{ akeebasubs * }Content to show to all subscribers{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

          <para>Additionally, you can use the "not" modifier (exclamation
          mark) to show content only to non-subscribers:</para>

          <programlisting>{ akeebasubs !* }Content to show to non-subscribers{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

          <para>You can use this trick to easily show different messages to
          subscribers and non-subscribers, no matter if you have decided on
          the final list or naming of your subscription levels.</para>

        <para>The purpose of the aslink plugin is to produce URLs to

        </note>

        <para>The aslink plugin only produces a URL, not a link. In order to

        code, as shown below.</para>

        <para>Syntax:</para>

        <programlisting>{ aslink MYLEVEL }</programlisting>

        <para>Returns the URL to a subscription level called "MYLEVEL", e.g.
        <uri>http://localhost/component/akeebasubs/new/mylevel?layout=default</uri>.</para>

        <programlisting>{ aslink mylevel }</programlisting>

        <para>Returns the URL to a subscription level whose slug is "mylevel",
        e.g.
        <uri>http://localhost/component/akeebasubs/new/mylevel?layout=default</uri>.</para>

        <programlisting>{ aslink 2 }</programlisting>

        <para>Returns the URL to a subscription level whose numeric ID is 2,
        e.g.
        <uri>http://localhost/component/akeebasubs/new/mylevel?layout=default</uri>.</para>

        <para>In order to find the numeric ID of a level, please go to your
        site's back-end, <guimenu>Components</guimenu>, <guisubmenu>Akeeba
        Subscriptions</guisubmenu>, <guimenuitem>Subscription
        Levels</guimenuitem> and click on the name of the subscription level
        you want. Note the URL in the browser. It's something like
        <uri>http://localhost/administrator/index.php?option=com_akeebasubs&amp;view=level&amp;id=2</uri>.
        The number after &amp;id= is the numeric ID of the level. In this
        example, the numeric ID is 2.</para>

        <para>Moreover, you can use the following syntax:</para>

        <programlisting>{ aslink view=levels }</programlisting>

        <para>to create a link to the Subscription Levels view. This is
        usually quicker than creating a link to a menu item and remembering to
        change that link whenever your menu structure changes.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Showing a CAPTCHA on your subscription page will result in
          many lost sales. By showing a CAPTCHA in the subscription page you
          are making your potential subscribers to think hard before they part
          with their money, as well as frustrate them (according to our
          experience, one in two CAPTCHAs is unsolvable and makes the user
          feel they are stupid). As any undergrad business school student can
          tell you, the more you make people think, the less likely they are
          to pay. Besides, if someone actually pays you he is certainly not a
          spammer, therefore the CAPTCHA is unnecessary.</para>

    <title>Akeeba Subscriptions' modules</title>

    <para>Akeeba Subscriptions comes with a variety of modules to display
    customized lists of subscription levels or a list of a user's
    subscriptions. Make sure you visit your Module Manager page and have a
    look at them. You can create interesting effects, like a customized and
    categorized subscriptions list page, out of those modules.</para>

    <section xml:id="modules-list-of-active-subs">
      <title>List of active subscriptions</title>

      <para>Displayed in the Modules Manager as: <guilabel>Akeeba
      Subscriptions - List of active subscriptions</guilabel></para>

      <para>This is extremely simple plugin will merely list the current
      user's active subscriptions as an unordered list. It is meant as an
      example of how you can create custom modules for Akeeba
      Subscriptions.</para>
    </section>

      <title>List subscription levels</title>

      <para>Displayed in the Modules Manager as: <guilabel>Akeeba
      Subscriptions - List subscription levels</guilabel></para>

      <para>This extremely powerful module allows you to present a list of all
      or specific subscription levels, using either layout, in any module
      position on your site. Combined with Joomla!'s { loadposition } plugin
      you can use this module to assemble the perfect presentation page of
      your subscriptions, grouped any way you please.</para>

      <para>The module has only two options:</para>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Subscription Levels</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Choose which subscription level(s) to display in the module.
            This is a multiple-selection list. You can use CTRL-click
            (Windows, Linux) or CMD-click (Mac OS X) to select multiple items
            on the list.</para>

    <title>Developers' information</title>

    <para>Akeeba Subscriptions was designed to be very extensible right from
    its inception. Everything can be accomplished using plugins which can be
    installed through the familiar Joomla! extensions installer.</para>

    <para>The plugins can belong to one of two groups:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>akeebasubs</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>This is the plugin group where all integrations live. Plugins
          in this group can implement a plethora of methods which allows them
          to be notified when a subscription's status changes, when the user
          information is read/written and much more.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>akpayment</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>This plugin group is used by Akeeba Subscriptions payment
          plugins. Plugins in this group implement special methods which
          allows them to be notified of the user's intention to pay for a
          subscription, as well as process the payment notification by the
          payment processor and, in turn, let the component know.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>The rest of this chapter documents the various plugin events in each
    group. References to existing plugins are made so that you can understand
    how things really work.</para>

      <title>The "akeebasubs" plugin events</title>

      <section xml:id="dev-onAKSubscriptionChange">
        <title>onAKSubscriptionChange</title>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Prototype</emphasis>: <code>public
        function onAKSubscriptionChange($row, $info)</code></para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Synopsis</emphasis>: This event is called
        whenever a subscription is created or modified.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Sample plugin</emphasis>:
        plugins/akeebasubs/subscriptionemails.php</para>

        <para>The <code>$row</code> variable contains a JTable descendant
        which gives you access to all of the information in the subscription
        record (#__akeebasubs_subscriptions table's fields). The
        <code>$info</code> variable contains a hash array with useful
        information, including a copy of table before and after the
        modification, the modified rows and the kind of modification (new for
        new record or modified for a modified existing record) that took
        place.</para>

        <para>You cannot change the information in $row or pass data back to
        the component in any way. In fact, this event is called immediately
        after all information has been written to the database.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="dev-onAKUserRefresh">
        <title>onAKUserRefresh</title>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Prototype</emphasis>: <code>public
        function onAKUserRefresh($user_id)</code></para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Synopsis</emphasis>: This event is called
        when the user clicks on the "Refresh Integrations" button in the
        back-end of the Akeeba Subscriptions component. It is called once per
        each subscriber. The $user_id variable contains the numeric Joomla!
        user ID of the subscriber.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Sample plugin</emphasis>:
        plugins/akeebasubs/joomla.php</para>

        <para>You might consider it odd that the event is called per user
        instead of per subscription. However, the integrations in Akeeba
        Subscriptions are "smart". This means that instead of triggering
        functionality based on the enabled status of an individual
        subscription they work based on the enabled status of all
        subscriptions. This allows you to have rules like "if the user has
        SUB1 and SUB2, do this" or "if the user has SUB1 and had a SUB2 but it
        has now expired, do that". Looking at the sample plugin's code you can
        understand how the iteration of the user's subscriptions is made and
        how a plugin can determine which subscription levels the user belongs
        to.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="dev-onSubscriptionFormRender">

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Prototype</emphasis>: <code>public
        function onSubscriptionFormRender($userparams, $cache)</code></para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Synopsis</emphasis>: This event is called
        when the subscription form (front-end, view=level) is displayed. It
        returns an array of extra fields which will be rendered in the form,
        right below the email field and before the address fields.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Sample plugin</emphasis>:
        plugins/akeebasubs/samplefields.php</para>

        <para>The input of this event's method is two variables:</para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>$userparams</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>This is a copy of the user's record, as stored in the
              #__akeebasubs_users table, in object format. You can access the
              data in the user record as, for example,
              <code>$userparams-&gt;address1</code> in order to get the
              Address 1 field's contents.</para>

              <para>The most important -for you- part of this object is
              <code>$userparams-&gt;params</code> which stores all the extra
              fields' values. For example, if you have defined a field named
              foobar, you can get its stored value as
              <code>$userparams-&gt;params-&gt;foobar</code>.</para>

              <important>
                <para>This object contains the data stored in the database.
                When the user modified this data in the interface and submits
                the form (but the form is invalid) the information in this
                object IS NOT UPDATED. In this case, use the
                <code>$cache</code> variable.</para>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>$cache</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>When the user submits the subscription forms but it is
              invalid (errors don't allow it to pass the validation), Akeeba
              Subscriptions stores the user's modified data in the $cache
              array. The information in this array may be different than the
              information in $userparams array.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>

        <bridgehead>Getting the values for your custom fields</bridgehead>

        <para>To cut a long story short, if you have a field named foobar,
        here is how to get its value:</para>

        <programlisting>if(array_key_exists('<replaceable>foobar</replaceable>', $cache['custom'])) {
  $current = $cache['custom']['<replaceable>foobar</replaceable>'];
} else {
  $current = property_exists($userparams-&gt;params, '<replaceable>foobar</replaceable>') ? $userparams-&gt;params-&gt;<replaceable>foobar</replaceable> : <replaceable>'default value'</replaceable>;
}</programlisting>

        <bridgehead>Returning custom field definitions</bridgehead>

        <para>The return of this event is an array which consists of one or
        more hash (key/value pair) arrays. Each of the hash arrays defines
        exactly one extra field and has the following keys:</para>

        <bridgehead>Javascript validation</bridgehead>

        <para>Akeeba Subscriptions does not make any attempt to validate the
        custom fields and update the display status of the valid/invalid
        labels. It is your responsibility. In this event, you can call
        <code>JFactory::getDocument()-&gt;addScriptDeclaration($scriptData)</code>
        where $scriptData is the Javascript validation code.</para>

        <para>In order to make it easier for you, Akeeba Subscriptions offers
        an architecture similar to an observer pattern in the Javascript code.
        You can have Javascript functions called when Akeeba Subscriptions'
        Javascript code is fetching the contents of the fields before sending
        a data validation request through AJAX and another function which is
        called when the validation results are being processed. You can add
        the former to the stack using addToValidationFetchQueue() and the
        latter using addToValidationQueue().</para>

        <para>Please look at the very well documented sample plugin for more
        information regarding all of the above.</para>
