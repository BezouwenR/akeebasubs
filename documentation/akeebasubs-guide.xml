      subscriptions without any hidden costs. We love Freedom of choice as
      much as you do!</para>

      <bridgehead>The killer features</bridgehead>

      <para>Its feature list is nothing short of amazing. Out of the box,
      Akeeba Subscriptions supports these features:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Streamlined administrator interface which can even present you
          an interactive sales graph and sales report as soon as you launch
          the component</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Rich subscription levels (subscription packages) editor which
          allows you to choose different images for each of your subscriptions
          and even a different order confirmation and order cancellation text
          to show to your users.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The easiest subscription management interface you've seen on a
          component. It will even show you your users' faces, powered by
          Gravatar.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Users can upgrade or expand (renew) their subscriptions.
          Renewing a subscription will create a new subscription which becomes
          valid the very second their old one expires. Users do not lose any
          of their subscription time when renewing, unlike most other
          subscription systems out there.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Full support for delayed payments, e.g. when using e-checks
          with PayPal.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Discount coupon codes which allow you to set an absolute money
          value or percentage discount for all or a specific subscription
          level and user, have publish up/publish down dates or a usage limit
          (e.g. the coupon code is valid only for the first 100 people to use
          it) – or a combination of any and all of the above!</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Automatic discounts for upgrading or renewing subscriptions
          based on the subscription level and days of presence in the
          subscription package. This allows you to easily create rules like:
          30% discount if you renew up to 30 days before the end of your
          subscription, 15% discount if you renew within the last 30 days, no
          discount otherwise.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Full support for complex tax calculations based on country,
          state and ZIP code. It fully integrates with the European Union's
          VIES system so that you can charge no VAT tax for intra-EU B2B
          transactions.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The subscription form can work with or without Javascript.
          With Javascript it becomes a fully fledged, auto-validating
          subscription form. Without Javascript it works as a standard web
          form, accessible to users who do not wish / cannot use Javascript on
          their browser.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Integration with Joomla! user groups. This allows direct
          integration with several popular components such as JCE, DOCman, K2
          etc.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Special integrations for third party components. Check out our

          <para>Payment methods: PayPal (for personal, verified and business
          accounts) is supported out of the box. Other payment methods are

      <para>Please note that the software is provided free of charge, but
      support is not. You need to have an AKEEBADELUXE, SUPPORT or
      FORUMSUPPORT subscription on AkeebaBackup.com to seek support regarding
      setting up, using and customizing Akeeba Subscriptions. Please note that
      we can not help you with design requests or write customisation code for
      you. We can, however, help you by telling you what you have to do to

        <bridgehead>Joomla! is logging you out during
        installation</bridgehead>

        <para>The first thing you might observe is that <emphasis
        role="bold">Joomla! is logging you out when trying to
        install</emphasis> Akeeba Subscriptions. This is due to a bug in
        Joomla! session handling (the session storage space is too small).
        Please <link
        xlink:href="http://docs.joomla.org/Why_does_the_administrator_logoff_all_of_the_sudden">follow
        these instructions</link> to fix the database table that causes this
        issue. After doing that you will have to log in again to your site.
        You will see that everything is missing from the back-end interface.
        Don't panic! That's part of the Joomla! bug. Just log out using the
        link on the top-right of your page, then log back in. Everything is
        back to normal and you can retry the installation.</para>

        <bridgehead>Joomla! says "can't build admin menu" and fails or Akeeba
        Subscriptions' entry under the Components menu disappears</bridgehead>

        <note>
          <para>This problem should be mostly fixed as of Joomla! 2.5.6 and
          later releases</para>
        </note>

        <para>On some other occasions, especially when trying to install or
        update the component after an installation error, Joomla! will
        complain that it <emphasis role="bold">cannot build admin
        menus</emphasis>. This is due to another Joomla! bug <link
        xlink:href="http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/joomla/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&amp;tracker_item_id=25663">we
        have sent a patch for</link> to the Joomla! development team.
        Meanwhile, you will have to run a few SQL statements against your
        database with a database editor such as phpMyAdmin:</para>

        <programlisting>DELETE FROM jos_assets WHERE `name` = 'com_akeebasubs';
DELETE FROM jos_menu WHERE `menutype` = 'main' AND `alias` = 'com_akeebasubs';
DELETE FROM jos_extensions WHERE `type` = 'component' AND `element` = 'com_akeebasubs';</programlisting>

        <para>Remember to change <replaceable>jos_</replaceable> with your
        database tables' name prefix if you changed it during installation!
        It's easy to find out what it is. Take a look at the database and
        you'll see that all of your tables begin with the same few letters.
        That's your prefix. After running those SQL statements you can proceed
        with the reinstallation of the component.</para>

        <bridgehead>Checking your temporary directory</bridgehead>

        <para>First, we will have to make sure that you are using a valid
        temporary directory. Many sites are configured to use the system-wide
        (/tmp) directory or an invalid directory, causing installation
        problems. In order to change your site's temporary directory setting
        you have to follow this procedure, depending on your Joomla!
        version.</para>

            <para>Connect to your site using FileZilla. Navigate inside the

            <filename>public_html</filename>, <filename>htdocs</filename>,
            <filename>www</filename> or something similar. If unsure don't ask
            us, ask your host. Now, on the right-hand pane you will find the
            FTP path. Most likely it will look something like
            <filename>/public_html</filename>. Copy this and paste it into the
            FTP Root text box in your Joomla!'s Global Configuration

        <bridgehead>Manual installation</bridgehead>

        <para>Sometimes <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> is unable to properly
        extract ZIP archives due to technical limitations on your server. In
        this case, you can follow a manual installation procedure.</para>

        <para>First, you have to extract the installation ZIP file in a
        subdirectory named <filename>akeeba</filename> on your local PC. Then,
        upload the entire subdirectory inside your site's temporary directory.
        At this point, there should be a subdirectory named
        <filename>akeeba</filename> inside your site's temporary directory
        which contains all of the ZIP package's files.</para>

        <para>If you are unsure where your site's temporary directory is
        located, you can look it up by going to the <guimenuitem>Global
        Configuration</guimenuitem>, click on the <guilabel>Server</guilabel>
        tab and take a look at the <guilabel>Path to Temp-folder</guilabel>
        setting. The default setting is the <filename>tmp</filename> directory
        under your site's root. Rarely, especially on automated installations
        using Fantastico, this might have been assigned the system-wide
        <filename>/tmp</filename> directory. In this case, please consult your
        host for instructions on how to upload files inside this directory, or
        read the instructions above about changing your
        <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> temporary directory back to the default
        location and making it writable.</para>

        <para>Assuming that you are past this uploading step, click on the
        <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Manage</guimenuitem>
        (Joomla! 1.6+ users) link on the top menu. In this page, locate the
        <guibutton>Install Directory</guibutton> edit box in the
        <guilabel>Install from Directory</guilabel> area. It is already filled
        in with the absolute path to your temporary directory, for example
        <filename>/var/www/joomla/tmp</filename>. Please append
        <filename>/akeeba</filename> to it. As per our example, it should look
        something like <filename>/var/www/joomla/tmp/akeeba</filename>. Then,
        click on the <guibutton>Install</guibutton> button.</para>

        <bridgehead>Still problems?</bridgehead>

        <para>If you still can't install Akeeba Subscriptions and you are
        receiving messages regarding unwritable directories, inability to move
        files or other similar file system related error messages, please do
        not ask us for support. These errors stem from your site set up and
        can best be resolved by asking for help in the <link
        xlink:href="http://forum.joomla.org">official
        <trademark>Joomla!</trademark> forums</link>. We can only support
        software we develop ourselves. Joomla!'s extension installer is
        certainly not developed by us and –believe us– we have tried to
        improve it and submitted some still pending patches to the Joomla!
        project. Therefore we regret that we have to say that, but we can't
        help you. Thank you for your understanding.</para>

        <title>Updating to the latest release</title>

        <para>Akeeba Subscriptions can be updated with two different methods:
        installing the new version on top of the old one or using the
        integrated Live Update system.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Akeeba Subscritpions 2.5.0 and later no longer support using
          Joomla!'s integrated extensions installer. The problem with
          Joomla!'s feature is that it does not allow you to select the
          minimum stability level of the update. This has traditionally led
          users installing unstable versions on their live sites, ending up in
          support requests and frustration. Moreover, the integrated Joomla!
          extensions update is unreliable on many shared hosts. Unless these
          significant issues are addressed we are going to keep on using our
          own Akeeba Live Update.</para>
        </important>

        <bridgehead>Updating directly</bridgehead>

        <para>This is the failsafe approach, but the least convenient.
        Download the latest Akeeba Subscriptions release from <link
        xlink:href="https://www.AkeebaBackup.com/latest">https://www.AkeebaBackup.com/latest</link>
        and save the ZIP file to your hard disk. Log in to your site's
        backend, click on <guimenuitem>Extensions Manager</guimenuitem>
        (Joomla! 1.6 and later). Use the <guibutton>Browse...</guibutton>
        button to locate the ZIP file you downloaded, then click on
        <guibutton>Upload and Install</guibutton>. All Joomla! versions since
        1.5.5 are smart enough to understand that you're doing an upgrade
        instead of installation and adjust the process accordingly.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Do NOT uninstall Akeeba Subscriptions before updating it!
          Uninstalling will remove all of your data, including all subscriber
          information!</para>

        <bridgehead>Using Live Update</bridgehead>

        <para>Since Akeeba Subscriptions 1.0.0 we have integrated our Live
        Update system inside Akeeba Subscriptions. Log in to your site's
        backend and go to <guimenu>Components</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Akeeba
        Subscriptions</guimenuitem>. Look towards the bottom of the page.
        There should be an icon which reads "Update found" when there is a new
        version available. Click on it and then click on "Update now". The new
        version will be downloaded and installed automatically for you. In
        case this doesn't work, or if "Live Update not supported" is displayed
        below the icon, please make sure that your host's firewall allows
        TCP/IP communications over port 80 and 443 to
        <uri>akeebabackup.com</uri> and <uri>s3.amazonaws.com</uri>. If your
        host requests IP addresses instead of domain names, please ask them to
        trace them from the server as they are multicast hostnames, which
        means that they resolve to a different IP depending on where in the
        world you are.</para>

        <bridgehead>Something not working right after the update?</bridgehead>

        <para>Sometimes Joomla! "forgets" to copy all updated files. This is
        something that we have seen a few times. In this case, simply follow
        the instructions in the Updating Directly section above. This will
        force Joomla! to retry updating the component, copying the missing
        files and everything will work again.</para>

      <title>How subscriptions work and Quick Start</title>

      <para>Before you begin setting up Akeeba Subscriptions, you should be
      aware of the way subscriptions work under the hood. The most basic
      concept is the subscription level (referred to simply as Level from now
      on). This is what you are selling to your customers. Your customers buy
      a subscription to a Level. The composite piece of information containing
      the Level, payment information and expiration time is called a
      Subscription.</para>

      <para>When a user enters the subscription page, Akeeba Subscriptions
      first fetches the price associated with the Level your user wants to
      buy. It will then try to understand if there is an applicable discount.
      First, it will look into Upgrade definitions and produce a list of
      upgrade rules applicable for the user and the Level he wishes to buy. If
      there are multiple applicable upgrade rules, the one giving the maximum
      discount is elected. Next up, it takes a look at the coupon code, is
      supplied. If it is an active coupon and your user can use it to get a
      discount, the coupon's discount is calculated. In the case where there
      are two discounts, both an upgrade discount and a coupon discount, the
      highest one is elected. The level price minus the discount is called the
      Net Price.</para>

      <para>Right up, Akeeba Subscriptions will try to determine the
      applicable tax by going through all the tax rules. It will go through
      the tax rules and keep the one which is the closest match to the
      country, zip code, city and VIES registration status. If no match is
      found, Akeeba Subscriptions will select the tax rate defined in the very
      first tax rule you have defined. This is called the Tax Amount. The sum
      of the Net Price and Tax Amount is the Gross Amount and that's what the
      user will have to pay.</para>

      <para>When the user hits the Subscribe button, Akeeba Subscriptions will
      first check if this is a new or existing user. If it is a new user, it
      will create a new –but inactive– user account based on the information
      the user has supplied. A new, inactive subscription will be created for
      your user and he's redirected to the payment gateway. Exception: if you
      have an 100% or more discount (which means that the user shall pay
      nothing) he's not redirected to the payment gateway. Instead, he's
      redirected to the Subscription Confirmation page and his subscription
      becomes instantly active.</para>

      <para>Once the user finishes the payment, he's redirected to the
      Subscription Confirmation page. If he changes his mind and cancels the
      payment, he will be taken to the Subscription Cancellation page. The
      text on each page is determined by the relevant fields in the Level
      configuration.</para>

      <para>At the same time, your payment processor will send a post-back to
      your site, notifying Akeeba Subscriptions about the payment status. If
      the payment is marked as complete, the subscription is activated. Its
      start and expiration date are calculated based on the exact date and
      time that the payment post-back was received and the Level's configured
      length. If the associated user account was marked as blocked (inactive),
      it is activated. If any integrations are set up, they will run. For
      example, you may be adding users to JUGA groups upon a successful
      subscription.</para>

      <para>Based on the above, you need to configure the following –in the
      order shown– for Akeeba Subscriptions to work:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Configuration Options - well, that's just the currency you're
          selling in!</para>

          <para>Upgrade rules - (optional) discounts based on what other
          products the user has bought and how long he's been a subscriber to

        <listitem>
          <para>Coupons - (optional) discount codes used for promotions</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Alternatively, you can import Subscription Levels and Coupons from
      other subscription systems instead of manually defining them.</para>

      <para>The sections below will tell you how to go through each of these
      steps.</para>

      <bridgehead>How to make it all work together to make money from your
      site</bridgehead>

      <note>
        <para>The procedure outlined below works with Akeeba Subscriptions
        2.4.5 or later. For earlier versions please consult the documentation
        PDF file of your Akeeba Subscriptions version.</para>
      </note>

      <para>What we described above cover just one small part of Akeeba
      Subscriptions' functionality: how to create something that your clients
      can buy and how to sell it. Obviously, your clients expect to get
      something for the money they paid. In other words, you need to make the
      subscriptions <emphasis>do something</emphasis> on your site. Akeeba
      Subscriptions' integration plugins are that magic glue which binds
      together subscriptions and features on your site.</para>

      <para>In order to make it easier to understand, let's take a simple
      example. You want to set up a magazine site. Subscribers will have
      access to premium content. You want to sell 3, 6 and 12 months
      subscriptions. How can you do it? Very easily, but you have to start
      <emphasis>backwards</emphasis>. We will set up you site's Joomla! ACL to
      limit access to the premium content, Akeeba Subscriptions to sell
      subscriptions to the premium content and the <guilabel>Akeeba
      Subscriptions - Joomla! Usergroups Integration</guilabel> plugin as the
      glue to link Joomla! ACL (usergroups) to subscriptions. Still with us?
      Let's see how we can do it in 5 minutes or less.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Setting up Joomla! access control (ACL) for
      your content</bridgehead>

      <para>First, we have to ensure that premium content can only be accessed
      by subscribers only. Using Joomla!'s powerful access control features it
      is very easy to do so. Before we begin, we strongly recommend reading
      some more about how Joomla! access control works:</para>

      </screenshot>

      <para>In the new page enter Premium Content as your level title and
      select ONLY the Subscriber group. There are two very common mistakes
      we've seen people doing:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Using the Registered or any other built-in user group instead
          of a dedicated Subscriber user group. This is wrong. Without getting
          into too much technical details and rare exceptions, you should keep
          in mind that all Joomla! user accounts belong to the Registered
          group. Otherwise they wouldn't be able to log in at all. If you use
          the Registered group as your subscribers group then all users are
          subscribers, no matter if they paid or not. This is not a bug in
          Akeeba Subscriptions, it's how Joomla! works.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Some people select both the Subscriber and Registered (or,
          worse, Public!) user groups in their Viewing Access Level. This is
          wrong. A user has access to content assigned to a particular Viewing
          Access Level if he belongs to <emphasis>any</emphasis> of the groups
          selected in the Viewing Access Level or one of their children
          groups. For example, if you select the Manager group in a Viewing
          Access Level then user who belong to either the Manager or the
          Administrator user group have access to the content. This happens
          because the Administrator group is a child (is
          <emphasis>under</emphasis>) the Manager group. This takes some
          getting used to, no doubt. Again, this is not a bug with Akeeba
          Subscriptions, it's the way Joomla! is designed to work.</para>

      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Then click on <guibutton>Save &amp; Close</guibutton>.</para>

      <para>Then you have to set the Access to all the premium Joomla!
      articles and components to, you guessed it, Premium Content. The easiest
      way is using the batch processing feature of Joomla!. Go to Joomla!
      article manager, select all the subscriber-only articles and scroll
      down. You'll see the <guilabel>Batch process the selected articles
      area</guilabel>. Set the <guilabel>Set Access Level</guilabel> to

      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Using Akeeba Subscriptions to sell access
      to your site</bridgehead>

      <para>Before we go back to defining our subscription levels, you have to
      do one small thing. Go to the Extensions, Plugin Manager page and make
      sure that the "Akeeba Subscriptions - Joomla! Usergroups Integration"
      plugin is enabled.</para>

      <screenshot>
        <info>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>

      <para>Then, we will set up the three subscription levels. Go to
      <guimenu>Components</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Akeeba
      Subscriptions</guimenuitem>. Click on the <guimenu>Setup</guimenu>,
      <guimenuitem>Subscription Levels</guimenuitem> menu item.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>

      <para>The first level is called <option>3MONTHS</option> and has a
      duration of 90 days. The second one is called <option>6MONTHS</option>
      and has a length of 180 days. The last one is called
      <option>12MONTHS</option> and has a length of 365 days. For each plugin,
      in the Integration area, she has to click on the User Groups tab. Most
      likely it's the only tab and it's already active. See those "Add to
      Joomla! Usergroups" and "Remove from Joomla! Usergroups" lists? She just
      has to select the <option>Subscribers</option> group on each one of
      them. This tells Akeeba Subscriptions to add the subscribers to the
      Subscribers group once their subscription is enabled and remove them
      from this group when their subscription expires.</para>

      <important>
        <para>Make sure each subscription level has its Published option set
        to Yes, otherwise users won't be able to subscribe to it.</para>
      </important>

      <para>For example, here's how to set up the 3MONTHS level:</para>

      <para>Don't be intimidated by the many options you see in here. Stick to
      the basic option and don't touch what you don't understand. Once you set
      up your site you have all the time in the world to read the
      documentation and deal with the more advanced options.</para>

      <para>One important detail left: handling user payments. Essentially,
      you need a payments processor that Akeeba Subscriptions can talk to and
      ask them to handle the gory details of payments. The easiest option is
      PayPal. Setting it up is very easy, indeed. For the purpose of this
      tutorial we are going to demonstrate how you can integrate with PayPal

      paperwork until you reach a certain income level. Of course, Akeeba
      Subscriptions supports dozen of payment processors other than PayPal. If
      you haven't done so already, you have to go to PayPal and open a new
      account.</para>

            reported that the login feature is confusing and redundant, as

          <listitem>
            <para>This is the tax rate (in percentage units) used ONLY for
            front-end display. We strongly advise against using this option
            unless you are obliged to for legal reasons.</para>

            <para>One of the problems faced by our users is that they have to
            display prices inclusive VAT, no matter if they have tax rules
            which define that no VAT tax will be applied in some cases. So far
            the only way to do that was editing Akeeba Subscriptions' files
            directly or doing template overrides. This option is here to
            eliminate that need.</para>

            <para>Please note that this value IS NOT taken into account when
            calculating the amount of money to charge to the subscriber. It
            only modifies the price displayed in the All Levels view.</para>

            <para>Example: Let's say you have a subscription level which costs
            10 EUR. You enter a "Tax rate for display" value of 19. The price
            of the subscription level will be listed as 11.90 EUR (that's 10
            EUR plus 19% VAT).</para>

          <term>Require valid coupon</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>There are some cases when you want your users to enter an
            "authorization code" before they can subscribe. One prime example
            is a complimentary subscription to your site once a user buys a
            tangible or intangible good from you, or when you want to track
            the origin of your subscribers. When this option is enabled it
            allows you to use Akeeba Subscriptions in such a scenario: in
            order for the user to be allowed to subscribe he will have to
            provide a valid coupon code. If no valid code is provided the user
            will not be allowed to proceed with the subscription. You can
            always create coupon codes withe their type set to Amount and
            their value set to 0 to create "authorization codes" which only
            allow users to subscribe but not give them any discount.</para>

            free subscription it will enabled automatically.</para>

            <para>When this option is enabled, the subscription to a
            subscription level with a price of 0 will be activated
            automatically, but the new user account will not. Instead, the
            standard Joomla! user activation email will be sent out, using

            itself, NOT Akeeba Subscriptions.</para>

            <para>The email which is sent by this feature depends on your
            Joomla! User Manager setup. Go to Joomla!'s <guilabel>User
            Manager</guilabel> and click on the <guibutton>Options</guibutton>
            button. In the <guilabel>Component</guilabel> area you have to set
            <guilabel>New User Activation</guilabel> to either
            <option>Self</option> or <option>Admin</option>. When you select
            Self an email will be sent to the user with the free subscription
            containing an activation link. Visiting it will activate his user
            account. When it is set to Admin the administrators of the site
            will receive an email which will allow them to manually activate
            the user with the free subscription. If you select
            <option>None</option> then no email is sent and the free
            subscribers will never get activated! Please remember that the

          <listitem>
            <para>Normally, invoice numbers are monotonically increasing
            integers (1, 2, 3, 4, ...). Sometimes you need to be able to
            customise the format of the invoice number to match your
            preferences or requirements imposed by your local tax authorities.
            This setting allows you to define how the invoice numbers will be
            formatted. You can use a mix of text and "variables". The
            available variables are:</para>

                  <para>Returns a specific part of the current date and time.
                  The exact part of the date/time that will be returned is
                  defined by <replaceable>x</replaceable>. This can take a

                  date() function</link>. For example, [D:y] will return the
                  year (four digits), [D:m] will return the month and so
                  on.</para>

                  it will be zero padded. For example, let's consider invoice
                  #12. [N:1] will return 12. [N:5] will return 00012

      the toolbar links area.</para>

      <para>Subscription level groups allow you to visually group subscription
      levels in related groups. Moreover, subscription level groups modify the
      way Akeeba Subscriptions defines the Valid From date of new
      subscriptions.</para>

      <para>When a subscription level doesn't belong to a group and the user
      buys a new subscription on this level the Valid From date for the new
      subscription is set to the furthest in future Valid To date of other
      paid subscriptions in the same level. If this date is in the past, the
      current date and time is used. For example, if a user has a yearly
      subscription until June 1st and he buys a new subscription on May 1st
      his new subscription begins on June 1st this year and expires on June
      1st the next year. If, however, the user tries to buy a new subscription
      on August 1st, his new subscription will begin on August 1st this year
      and expire on July 31st next year. Any other subscriptions in other
      subscription levels are ignored during this calculation. With
      subscription level groups this changes a little. Instead having Akeeba
      Subscriptions only look for other subscriptions in the same subscription
      level, it now looks for all subscriptions in all levels belonging to the
      same group.</para>

      <para>In practice, this means that if you have –let's say– a 3 month, a
      6 month and a yearly subscription you should put them in the same group.
      No matter which subscription your user buys and in which order he will
      not lose any subscription time. Moreover, if you have a trial and a full
      subscription you should put both of them in the same group. Thus your
      users can upgrade from trial to full without losing subscription
      time.</para>

            <important>
              <para>This feature is VERY powerful. Just like Joomla!'s ACLs it
              will obediently allow someone to create the most pointless
              setups possible. Remember that a user must ALREADY belong to a
              group contained in this access level to be able to subscribe to
              this subscription level. For instance, let's say have a user
              group called Subscribers and a viewing access level called
              Subscriber Access containing only the Subscribers group. If you
              set a subscription level to the Subscribers access level then a
              user must already be a subscriber (belong to the Subscribers
              user group) before they can subscribe to your site. If this is
              your only subscription level you have just shot yourself in the
              feet. Think about it. If I need to be a subscriber before I can
              subscribe, how can I ever subscribe to your site?</para>

            "One-time" means that this fee is only charged once, when a user
            first subscribes to a subscription level. Just enter the amount of
            money to be charged above the regular price in this box. If you
            need to enter a decimal value, use a dot as the decimal separator.
            For example, 12.30 is valid, whereas 12,30 is INVALID and will be
            interpreted as 1230. Do NOT use a thousands separator. For example
            1000 is valid, whereas 1,000 is INVALID.</para>

            <para>There are some things you need to keep in mind when you are
            using a sign-up fee:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>The sign-up fee is only charged to users who have never
                subscribed to this subscription level before. If the user had
                already subscribed to this level anytime in the past (even
                years ago) he will not be charged this fee.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>The sign-up fee is added to the regular price of the
                subscription. If you have a tax rule, the tax will be
                calculated against the total amount of the price plus the
                sign-up fee.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Discounts such as coupons, upgrades and subscription
                level relations are applied to the sum of the price plus the
                sign-up fee. If you have a subscription level worth 80 Euros
                with a 20 Euro sign-up fee, a 20% coupon code will give the
                user 20% * (80 + 20 Euros) = 20 Euros discount NOT 20% * 80€ =
                16€.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>Sign-up fees do not work properly with recurring
                payments UNLESS you are using PayPal. PayPal will correctly
                charge the price plus sign-up fee only during the first
                subscription term, charging only the regular price from the
                second subscription term onwards (plus any applicable taxes,
                of course!). All other payment processors that support
                recurring payments will end up charging the full price plus
                the sign-up fee on every single payment term. As a result, if
                you are not using PayPal or if you are using PayPal plus other
                recurring payment provides we strongly advise AGAINST using
                sign-up fees with recurring payments.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Normally, subscriptions expire after a fixed amount of time
            since their creation. This is what the "Subscription length"
            option above does. In some cases you want to expire subscriptions
            on a specific fixed date. For example, a football club may want
            all of its subscriptions to end on July 1st, when the season
            officially ends. This is what the "Fixed expiration" is meant for.
            You have to enter the exact date (and, optionally, time) all
            subscriptions on this level will expire on. If you don't want to
            use this feature just leave it blank or use the pseudo-date
            "0000-00-00 00:00:00".</para>

            <important>
              <para>We recommend against using the expiration notification
              features with fixed expiration subscriptions. If you do use them
              please bear in mind the following:</para>

              <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                  <para>All expiration notification emails will be scheduled
                  for sending at the same time and date for all subscriptions
                  on this level. If you have 300 subscriptions then 300 emails
                  will be scheduled for the same date and time</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para>The expiration plugin will only send a handful of
                  emails on each page load. This means that it will need
                  several or even hundreds of page loads to send all
                  notification emails. This has major effects outlined
                  below.</para>

                <listitem>
                  <para>While your site is sending emails its performance will
                  suffer. You may experience an increase of page load time of
                  up to 3 seconds.</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para>Most mail servers ban email addresses and email
                  servers causing sudden traffic spikes on them. In other
                  words, if you end sending too many emails too fast to a
                  specific domain (e.g. many mails to GMail addresses) you
                  might end up being marked as a spammer and banned from
                  sending email to that domain again.</para>
                </listitem>

                <listitem>
                  <para>Many mail servers impose an email quota, i.e. a
                  maximum number of emails which can be sent per day from a
                  single email account. Most hosts have a limit of 500 or 1000
                  emails, whereas GMail and Google Mail for Applications has a
                  limit of 250 emails per day. If you go over this limit your
                  emails will not be sent and it's possible that your account
                  will be blocked.</para>
                </listitem>
              </itemizedlist>

              <para>So, to save you from trouble, we recommend not using
              notification emails with fixed date subscriptions unless you are
              perfectly aware of the risks involved and you believe that your
              site will not be adversely affected by them.</para>

            good reason.</para>

            <para>PHP and MySQL use something called UNIX timestamps to do
            date calculations, like determining if a date is in the future or
            how many days have elapsed since a certain date. Due to <link

            geeky stuff you probably don't care to understand</link> the
            maximum date which can currently be expressed is Tuesday, 19
            January 2038 03:14:07 UTC. That's why we use an easy to remember
            date which is as close to this End of Time as possible.</para>

            <para>OK, let's also take this practically. At the time of this
            writing (November 2012), January 2038 is roughly 26 years in the
            future. That's more than the lifespan of the Web as we know it (it
            was born in 1989, 23 years ago, and took another 5 to become
            mainstream) and it has radically changed ever since. Joomla!'s
            predecessor, Mambo, was born in 2001. Believing that in 26 years
            you will still be in the same business with the same business
            model as today, we will be using 2012's web technologies, Joomla!,
            Akeeba Subscriptions and anything else we are used to right now is
            a pipe dream. So, yes, 26 years into the future is MORE than the
            lifetime of your site, your business model, my business model and
            the web as we know it.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>When a subscription is not part of a group, the Valid From
            date of a new subscription is set to the maximum Valid To date of
            a properly paid (payment status set to "Completed") subscription
            at the same level. This is what allows Akeeba Backup to treat
            purchases of a new subscription on the same level as a renewal of
            the subscription.</para>

            <para>When a subscription is part of a group, the Valid From date
            of a new subscription is set to the maximum Valid To date of a

            any level belonging to this group.</para>

            <para>For example, let's say FOOBAR6 is a subscription level with
            a 6 month duration and FOOBAR12 is a subscription level with a 12
            month duration. A user has a subscription in the FOOBAR6 level

                <para>No matter of the level grouping, if he buys a new

          <listitem>
            <para>Normally Akeeba Subscriptions will determine the renewal
            page's URL automatically, sending the user to re-subscribe to the
            same subscription level he's renewing. This is not desirable in
            some cases. You can enter a custom renewal URL here. A few things
            to notice:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>When you enter a custom renewal URL the Renew button
                will be shown in the front-end of your site even when the
                subscription level has Forbid renewals set to Yes. In this
                case the renewal URL will be the custom URL you've entered
                here.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>If a user tries to manually access the subscription URL
                of a subscription level which has Forbid renewals set to Yes
                he will normally be shown a 403 Forbidden error page if he
                already has a subscription to this level. When the
                subscription level, however, has a custom renewal URL he will
                not be shown an error page; he will be redirected to the

      <bridgehead>Multi-lingual support</bridgehead>

      <para>Akeeba Subscriptions 2.0 and later are able support multi-lingual
      sites without the need of a third-party extension. This is done by using
      language code "merge tags" in the three last fields outlined above:
      short description, message to show after successful sign-up and message
      to show after sign-up cancellation. The merge tags in the text look like
      this:</para>

      <programlisting>[IFLANG en-GB]This is the English description[/IFLANG]
[IFLANG fr-FR]Ceci est la description française[/IFLANG]
[IFLANG de-DE]Diese ist die deutsche Beschreibung[/IFLANG]
[IFLANG el-GR]Αυτή είναι η Ελληνική περιγραφή[/IFLANG]</programlisting>

      <para>Essentially, you have to wrap your per-language text in
      <code>[IFLANG <replaceable>languageCode</replaceable>]</code> and
      <code>[/IFLANG]</code> merge tags. The languageCode you must use is the
      five letter language code used by Joomla!'s translation packages. For
      example, the English language is en-GB (British English), en-AU
      (Australian English) or en-US (Unites States English), German is de-DE
      (Germany) or de-AT (Austria) and so forth. If you're unsure, please go
      to your site's back-end, Language Manager and take a look at the
      language code in there.</para>

      <para>Please note that you cannot use the same language code
      twice.</para>

      <bridgehead>Customising the messages to show on successful sign-up and
      cancellation</bridgehead>

      <para>Since Akeeba Subscriptions 2.0.a3, you can personalise the
      messages which are shown after a successful sign-up or cancellation of
      the subscription process. This is done using "merge codes". The merge
      codes are explained below. Please note that you can use them in
      conjunction with Joomla! content plugins as well. In fact, using the
      merge codes you are open to a world of possibilities, even integrating
      an external affiliate system –like OSI Affiliates– on your site.</para>

      <para>The available merge codes are listed in the Message variables

      <para>Out of the box, Akeeba Subscriptions is set up to not apply any
      VAT or other tax at all. However, this is not what most users would
      like. Below we are providing the most common setups based on your
      business type. Our lawyers told us that we have to say this to you:
      Please note that we are not lawyers or tax technicians. As a result, our
      advice is based on our personal experience, may be flawed and in no way
      should be considered a legal or financial advice. Should you chose to
      use it you do so at your own risk. We strongly advise you to ask a
      qualified tax technician, lawyer or other relevant professional
      qualified by law to give you advice regarding tax laws. That said,
      here's the most common tax setups:</para>

      <bridgehead>Extra-EU businesses, e.g. US based</bridgehead>

      <para>Tax Rules determine if the user should be charged a tax amount on
      top of the regular price of the subscription level. If you do not wish
      to charge any taxes (e.g. you have already included any applicable taxes
      in your subscription price), you will still have to create a default
      rule with 0 tax charges. In order to do so, click on the New button,
      select the "- Select -" option in the Country drop-down and set the tax
      rate to 0, then click on Save. Now you have created a catch-all rule
      with 0% tax. Likewise, if you want to charge all users a flat tax rate,
      say 18%, do the same thing, but set the tax rate to your desired
      percentage, in our case 18 (note: without the % sign!) and click on
      Save.</para>

      <bridgehead>Intra-EU businesses with a VIES registered VAT number, or
      extra-EU businesses with an EU VAT number</bridgehead>

      <para>If you are a business based in the European Union with a
      VIES-registered VAT number you have to create a total of 30 rules to
      conform to the overcomplicated EU tax regulations. First, create a
      default rule with 0% tax as noted above. Then do the same thing, but set
      the <guilabel>VIES Reg</guilabel> option to Yes and the tax rate to 0%.
      Now create new tax rules for each one of these countries, <guilabel>VIES
      Reg</guilabel> set to No and tax rate set to your local VAT tax rate
      (e.g. 23% for Greece): Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech
      Republic, Germany, Greece, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Hungary,
      Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands,
      Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, United
      Kingdom. For the country of your business (e.g. Greece for a
      Greece-based business) create on more rule with <guilabel>VIES
      Reg</guilabel> set to Yes and the tax rate set to your local VAT tax
      rate (e.g. 23% for Greece).</para>

      <para>After setting up the tax rules you need to pay attention to the
      ordering of the rules. The correct ordering of the rules is:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Create one rule for each EU country <emphasis>including
          yours</emphasis> with VIES Reg set to No and the tax rate set to
          your local VAT rate</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Create one rule for <emphasis>your country only</emphasis>
          with VIES Reg set to Yes and the tax rate set to your local VAT
          rate</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Create one rule with no country selected, VIES Reg set to Yes,
          tax rate set to 0.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Create one rule with no country selected, VIES Reg set to No,
          tax rate set to 0.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>This way, the following happens:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If the customer is extra-EU he will be charged no VAT (the
          last rule kicks in)</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If the customer is intra-EU, but not a business with a
          VIES-registered VAT number, he's paying VAT (the first rules kicks
          in).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If the customer is an intra-EU business, he will be charged no
          VAT. He's liable to VAT on his local tax authorities, not your
          country's tax authorities.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If the customer is from your own country, you are charging him
          with VAT no matter of the VIES registration status (the third to
          last rule kick in).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Do note that the same setup is required if you are an extra-EU
      business –e.g. US-based– with an EU VAT ID (it's in the format
      EU012345678). In this case, you have no EU country of residence, so you
      can skip the last set of two tax rules mentioned above.</para>

      <bridgehead>Intra-EU businesses without a VIES-registered VAT
      number</bridgehead>

      <para>Please ask your lawyer whether it's legal for you to sell
      subscriptions to residents of a country other than yours. There is a gap
      in the EU directives regarding that case, therefore we can't provide you
      with even semi-accurate tax setup information within any stretch of
      imagination.</para>

      <bridgehead>Tax Rule options</bridgehead>

      <para>Each tax rule has the following options:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Country</term>

          <listitem>

            <para>A special type, available since version 2.2, is the "Percent

          <listitem>
            <para>The final discount is normally defined by the upgrade rule
            that generates the highest discount. When upgrade rules have the
            <guilabel>Combine</guilabel> option set to <option>Yes</option>,
            then all these (that apply to the subscriber's situation) will be
            added together (combined) to define the discount. In other words,
            the applicable upgrade rules with the Combined flag turned on work
            accumulatively instead of exclusively. This feature comes in handy
            when you want to give discounts to "bundle" subscriptions, i.e.
            subscription levels which give you the same privileges as buying
            several other subscription levels at the same time.</para>

            <para>Example #1 (without Combine):</para>

            <programlisting>Rule A gives $ 10 discount
Rule B gives $ 15 discount
Rule C gives $ 20 discount</programlisting>

            <para>Total discount will be $20 given by rule C because it's the
            biggest discount of the three.</para>

            <para>Example #2:</para>

            <programlisting>Rule A gives $ 10 discount =&gt; combine is on
Rule B gives $ 15 discount =&gt; combine is on
Rule C gives $ 20 discount</programlisting>

            <para>Total discount will be $25 given by rule A + B because A+B
            (combined) give a bigger discount than C.</para>

            <para>Example #3:</para>

            <programlisting>Rule A gives $ 10 discount =&gt; combine is on
Rule B gives $ 15 discount =&gt; combine is on
Rule C gives $ 30 discount</programlisting>

            <para>Total discount will be $30 given by rule C because C gives a
            bigger discount than A+B (combined).</para>

      <para>Practical examples of upgrade rules:</para>

      <para>You want to give a 30% discount to users with a SUB1 annual
      subscription if they renew up to 30 days before their subscription
      expiration. Both levels set to SUB1, min presence is set to 0, max
      presence is set to 335 (one year is 365 days, minus 30 days, equals 335
      days), discount type Percent, value 30.</para>

      <para>You want to give a 15% discount to users with a SUB1 annual
      subscription if they renew during the last 30 days of their
      subscription. Both levels set to SUB1, min presence is set to 335 (one
      year is 365 days, minus 30 days, equals 335 days), max presence set to
      365 (one full year) discount type Percent, value 15.</para>

      <para>You want to give a 10 Euro discount to users with a SUB1 annual
      subscription who are now buying a SUB2 subscription. From Level set to
      SUB1, To Level set to SUB2, min presence set to 0, max presence set to
      365 (one year), discount set to Value, value set to 10.</para>

      <para>You want users buying both SUB1 and SUB2 to have a 10 Euro
      discount. First, create a rule like in the previous example. Then create
      another rule with From Level set to SUB2, To Level set to SUB1, min
      presence set to 0, max presence set to 365, discount set to Value, value
      set to 10. This way, whichever subscription they buy first, they'll get
      the discount when they buy the other subscription as well.</para>

      <para>You want to give a complimentary (free) SUB3 subscription to users
      who have already bought SUB1 and SUB2: you can't do that with Upgrade
      Rules, as you cannot combine multiple subscriptions in a single rule.
      Instead, use a coupon code with 100% discount and show this coupon code
      only to subscribers who have already bought a SUB1 and SUB2 subscription
      using the Restricted Content plugin bundled with Akeeba
      Subscriptions.</para>

          emails for it) or have the new subscription become active when the

            paid subscriptions in the <guilabel>From Level</guilabel>
            subscription level with a Valid To date in the future. New
            subscription is the subscription which is being created in the

                  currently active old subscription. Use it when the To Level
                  provides the same access as the From Level with a different

            <para>Normally, Akeeba Subscriptions selects the Subscription

            combine the discount given by all applicable Level Relation rules
            which have "Combine with other rules" enabled and apply them all
            together. This is useful when you have, for example, a Bronze to
            Gold and a Silver to Gold relation, the user has booth a Bronze
            and Silver subscription and by upgrading to Gold you want to give
            him a combined discount.</para>

            option. If you chose <option>Percent</option>, you have to enter a
            number 0-100 in here (decimals, like 22.5) are allowed. If you
            chose <option>Value</option> enter the amount to be directly

      <para>On the other hand, if you selected the Flexible Discount you will
      see several fields. Remember that this mode will calculate the discount
      amount based on the remaining subscription time in the user's old

              remaining subscription time.</para>

              <para>So, the first field defines how much that X amount of
              flexible discount is. Please note that this field respects the
              <guilabel>Discount Type</guilabel> option. If you chose
              <option>Percent</option>, you have to enter a number 0-100 in
              here (decimals, like 22.5) are allowed. If you chose
              <option>Value</option> enter the amount to be directly deducted
              from the price.</para>

              <para>The next two fields are the "period quantiser" of the
              remaining subscription time. They let you define what Y is. You
              can choose to enter the period in days, weeks (understood as 7
              days), months (understood as 30 days) or years (understood as
              365 days). So, 2 months is equivalent to choosing 60 days. For
              every this much of remaining subscription time the user will get
              X discount.</para>

              <para>This is easier to understand with an example. Let's say
              that you select to give 1€ of discount every 10 days. If your
              subscriber has 40 days of subscription time left he will be
              given a discount of 4€. That's 40 days, divided by 10 days (your
              Y value), multiplied by 1€ (your X value).</para>

            <term>Low threshold fixed discount</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>Sometimes you want to give a fixed discount if the
              remaining time is below a certain amolimitunt. In these fields
              you can select how much discount to give if the subscription
              time remaining is less than a specific limit.</para>

              <para>The first field is your fixed discount. Please note that
              this field respects the <guilabel>Discount Type</guilabel>
              option. If you chose <option>Percent</option>, you have to enter
              a number 0-100 in here (decimals, like 22.5) are allowed. If you
              chose <option>Value</option> enter the amount to be directly
              deducted from the price.</para>

              <para>The second field is the amount of time below which this
              Low Threshold Fixed Discount is applied. It uses the same units
              you selected in the last Flexible Discount field above.</para>

              <para>For example, if the Flexible Discount is 1€ of discount
              every 10 days and selecting to give 3€ of discount if there are
              less than 30 days of subscription time left you will have the
              following result. If your subscriber has 40 days of subscription
              time left, he will be give a 4€ discount as explained in the
              Flexible Discount field above. If he has 25 days, he will be
              given a 3€ discount. Why? Because his remaining time (25 days)
              is less than your low threshold (30 days), so the fixed low
              threshold discount kicks in.</para>

              <para>The second field is the amount of time above which this
              High Threshold Fixed Discount is applied. It uses the same units
              you selected in the last Flexible Discount field above.</para>

              <para>For example, if the Flexible Discount is 1€ of discount
              every 10 days and selecting to give 5€ of discount if there are
              more than 50 days of subscription time left you will have the
              following result. If your subscriber has 40 days of subscription
              time left, he will be give a 4€ discount as explained in the
              Flexible Discount field above. If he has 120 days, he will be
              given a 5€ discount. Why? Because his remaining time (120 days)
              is more than your high threshold (50 days), so the fixed high

      </important>

      <para>This feature allows you to manage HTML email templates for all
      emails sent out by Akeeba Subscriptions. In contrast with the
      translation strings approach used in the Core release, this feature lets
      you manage your template emails more easily, define beautiful HTML email
      templates (instead of ugly plain text emails) and even set up different
      email messages per subscription level and language.</para>

      <para>You can access this feature by clicking on
      <guimenu>Setup</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>E-mail Templates</guimenuitem> in

            <para>This drop down displays all email types currently known to

            enough to query the currently published plugins if they support
            sending Akeeba Subscriptions-related emails and, if so, which
            email types they support. As a result you will only see the email
            types supported by currently published plugins. Make sure you have
            enabled all the e-mail related plugins you are interested in
            before trying to edit e-mail templates.</para>

            <para>Please note that this is a grouped list. The grayed out

      <para>This feature allows you to create discount coupon codes. When a

      from the price of his subscription. You can let coupons work on specific
      subscriptions, specific users, for a predefined time period or even for
      a predefined number of times before becoming inactive. You can even
      create 100% discount coupons for giveaways or other similar promotional
      reasons.</para>

      <note>
        <para>You can not publish/unpublish coupons. A coupon will be
        automatically published when the current date is between its Valid
        From / Valid To dates. Likewise, a coupon will be automatically
        unpublished when the current date is outside its Valid From / Valid To
        dates. In order to unpublish a coupon set its Valid To date in the
        past and it will be automatically unpublished.</para>

        <title>Coupons API</title>

        <para>You can access this feature by clicking on
        <guilabel>Coupons</guilabel>, <guilabel>API Coupons</guilabel> in the
        toolbar links area.</para>

        <para>There are many cases when you want to allow third parties to
        create coupon codes on your site automatically. For example a reseller
        who processes the transactions on their end might need to create 100%
        discount coupon codes for your site that his clients can redeem to
        subscribe to your site. Or you may have an ongoing deal with a third
        party to offer a discount on your subscriptions but do not wish to let
        them publish a coupon code common for every one of their clients, in
        fear of abuse (someone sharing the coupon code). In this case you need
        to use the Coupons API which allows on-demand generation of single use
        coupon codes.</para>

        <para>First you need to create at least one API entry for each one of
        your associates. The settings you can define for each API entry
        are:</para>

                  <para>Allow up to this many subscriptions to be created.
                  Similar to the above, but it actually counts how many
                  subscription have been created, i.e. how many of the coupon
                  codes have actually been used.</para>

                <listitem>
                  <para>This is not an exact science! Let's say that this

                  created 10 coupon codes but only 9 of them have been used.
                  He can now create an 11th coupon code. Let's assume that
                  this coupon code is immediately used. We are left with one
                  coupon code which has not been used. This coupon code CAN be
                  used by the user, so you'll end up with 11 used coupon codes
                  generated by this API key.</para>

                <listitem>
                  <para>Maximum value of discount given. Similar to the above,
                  but instead of counting how many coupon codes have been used
                  it counts how much money has been given as a discount.
                  Again, this is not an exact science so be warned.</para>

      <para>In order to edit a subscription, click on the leftmost column (the

            reversed or failed).</para>

            <para>The discount column will tell you if a discount was used and
            what type of discount. A dollar card followed by green bold text
            means that a coupon was used; the green text is the coupon's code.
            A magician's hat followed by brown text indicates that an Upgrade

            brown, italic letters if and only if a tax amount (as determined
            by a tax rule) was applied. Finally, the bigger, black, bold

              This is not a bug; it's the expected behaviour. The publish

              the valid from/ to dates. If the payment state is marked as
              "Completed" then the subscription is forced to be active within
              the time period defined by the valid from / to columns. If you
              want to disable a paid subscription, set its payment state to
              cancelled and unpublish it.</para>

      <para>You can use the <guibutton>Run Integrations</guibutton> button any
      time in order to have Akeeba Subscriptions re-process all integrations
      with third party components. This is useful when you suspect an
      integration has gone wrong, you changed the options in an integration
      plugin or you just imported a large number of subscriptions.</para>

      <para>Using the <guibutton>Export to CSV</guibutton> button allows you
      to export the current view into a CSV file for further processing in a
      spreadsheet application such as Microsoft Office Excel, Apple Numbers or
      OpenOffice.org Calc. Do note that the full set of raw data is dumped to
      the CSV file. What we mean is that the filters are applied, but instead
      of exporting just one page of data (what is displayed on your screen) it
      will export all pages of data.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>If you want to get the subscriptions list as CSV data through a
        CRON job, you can use the following URL:</para>

        <para>where www.example.com is the domain name of your site,
        yourusername is the user name of a Super User and yourpassword is the
        password of that user. Please do not use this URL from your local
        computer over an insecure HTTP connection for security reasons. Only
        use it in CRON jobs running on your server or when accessing your site
        over HTTPS (encrypted / SSL-secured connection).</para>

      <title>Affiliates management</title>

      <para>Since Akeeba Subscriptions 2.0.b1 there is a very basic affiliate
      management system. It is extremely (even stupidly!) simple by design. If
      you want something more complex, you can easily integrate Akeeba
      Subscriptions with a web-based affiliate management system, like OSI
      Affiliates.</para>

      <important>
        <para>We also ship plugins which allow you to integrate Akeeba
        Subscriptions with third party affiliate management solutions. Please
        take a look at the integration plugins section of our
        documentation.</para>
      </important>

      <para>The concept of affiliates in Akeeba Subscriptions is based on some
      simple rules:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>You manually create affiliates in the back-end of the
          component</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Each affiliate is linked to a Joomla! user account and is
          assigned a commission percentage</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>When you pay your affiliate, you manually create an affiliate
          payment record to let Akeeba Subscriptions know how much you paid
          him and when</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Each subscription with a payment status of C (Completed)
          counts towards the amount owed to the affiliate</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Each affiliate payment deducts from the amount owed to the
          affiliate</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>There is no "affiliate report" page of any kind</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>It's an extremely simple system, suitable for small sites with a
      handful of trusted affiliates. If you're interested in integrating a
      much more powerful third party affiliate system, please contact our
      support.</para>

      <bridgehead>How to use affiliates?</bridgehead>

      <para>Each affiliate has a unique numeric Affiliate ID. You can see that
      in the left-hand column in the affiliates management page. For our
      example, we'll assume that our affiliate has an ID of 123.</para>

      <para>In order for a sale to be registered to that affiliate, you need
      to redirect the prospective buyer to the subscription levels list page,
      having appended the <uri>affid=<replaceable>123</replaceable></uri> URL
      parameter at the end of the URL. For example, if your subscription level
      list page's URL is <uri>http://www.example.com/subscribe.html</uri> and
      your Affiliate ID is 123 then all visitors must visit the URL
      <uri>http://www.example.com/subscribe.html?affid=123</uri> for the sale

      <para>There are four types of front-end menu items you can
      create:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Subscribe • Specific Level</term>

          <listitem>

          <term>Subscription Levels • Awesome Layout</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Presents a list of all available subscription levels in a
            comparison table, using CSS3 styling. It's the most eye-catching
            presentation layout and it's best to use only if you have a small
            number of subscription levels (4 to 5)</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Subscription Levels • All Levels</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Presents a list of all available subscription levels as a
            two column list of boxes. It is a relatively dull presentation
            mode, but is suitable for a very large number of subscription
            levels (over 6)</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>My subscriptions • All of my subscriptions</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Think of it as a kind of "My Account" page. It shows the
            user all of his subscriptions and allows him to review the
            information on each one of them, as well as renew them.</para>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>

      <para>The subscription page defines two module positions where you can
      publish modules to further expand the information presented on the page.
      Publishing modules in the <option>akeebasubscriptionsheader</option>
      position will make them appear at the very top of the page, right above
      the Steps bar. That's a good place to publish information about SSL
      security or banners about your latest special offers. Publishing modules
      in the <option>akeebasubscriptionsfooter</option> position will make
      them appear right after the end of the subscription form. This is a good
      place to put a custom HTML module with links to your terms of service,
      business contact information, etc.</para>

      <para>Additionally, the page which lists the subscriptions defines
      another two module positions where you can publish modules to further
      expand the information presented on the page. Publishing modules in the
      <option>akeebasubscriptionslistheader</option> position will make them
      appear at the very top of the page, right above the list of subscription
      levels. Publishing modules in the
      <option>akeebasubscriptionslistfooter</option> position will make them
      appear right after the end of the subscription levels list.</para>

    <section xml:id="importing">
      <title>Importing data</title>

      <para>Akeeba Subscriptions allows you to import data from other
      subscription components and from other sources. This allows you to move
      data from an old subscriptions system into Akeeba Subscriptions.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>If you have recurring payments set up in your old system you
        must not import them to Akeeba Subscriptions. Recurring payments use a
        component-specific payment notification URL and integration code.
        Importing recurring subscriptions will lead to your customers being
        charged but their subscriptions not renewing. This is not a bug; it is
        how recurring payments work in all payment processors we know of. You
        will need to cancel existing recurring payments and instruct your
        users to resubscribe.</para>
      </warning>

      <section xml:id="importing-from-other-components">
        <title>Importing from other components</title>

        <para>Most likely you are already using a subscriptions system and
        wouldn't like to have to manually import all of your subscriptions to
        Akeeba Subscriptions. That's why we are offering an automated import
        feature. You can access it from Akeeba Subscription's dashboard page,
        by clicking on the Operations tab, and then on <guibutton>Import
        Data</guibutton>.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Importing from other components will DELETE AND REPLACE ANY
          AND ALL EXISTING DATA IN AKEEBA SUBSCRIPTIONS. There is NO TURNING
          BACK. Do NOT use this option after you have been using Akeeba
          Subscriptions and have new subscribers on your site.</para>
        </warning>

        <important>
          <para>Please remember to review your Subscription Levels after
          import. Most notably, the text of the subscription completion and
          subscription cancellation pages will be missing from all
          subscription levels.</para>

        <title>Importing from CSV</title>

        <para>If you are using a Joomla! subscriptions component not supported
        for direct import or a non-Joomla! system you need a way to quickly
        import your existing subscriptions to Akeeba Subscriptions. The
        fastest way is using the CSV import feature. CSV files can be
        generated by most subscription systems, spreadsheet applications (e.g.
        Microsoft Office Excel, OpenOffice/LibreOffice Calc, Apple Numbers,
        Google Docs etc) and database tools (e.g. phpMyAdmin). You can access
        the CSV import from Akeeba Subscription's dashboard page, by clicking
        on the Operations tab, and then on <guibutton>Import
        users</guibutton>.</para>

        <important>
          <para>You need to manually create the subscription levels before
          importing any data.</para>

          <para>Imported data will NOT overwrite existing subscriptions; it
          will simply append new subscriptions.</para>

          <para>All Akeeba Subscriptions integration plugins and Joomla! user
          plugins run when a new subscription or user (respectively) is
          created. In order to avoid emails being sent you must disable the
          Akeeba Subscriptions - Subscription e-mails plugin. To avoid
          invoices being created (which might lead to import failure) you have
          to disable all invoice related plugins, e.g. Akeeba Subscriptions -
          Integrated Invoicing. To avoid new user emails being generated you
          must edit the User - Joomla! plugin and disable sending emails from
          its basic options.</para>

          <para>The import can lead to timeout issues. Please try importing a
          few records (depending on your server, 10 to 100) at a time.
          Importing hundreds or thousands of records will probably lead to a
          white page, Internal Server Error 500 or a timeout error
          page.</para>

          <para>The first line of the CSV file MUST contain the column
          names.</para>

      <para>This feature was added in Akeeba Subscriptions 3.4.0.</para>

      <important>
        <para>You need to publish the "Akeeba Subscriptions - Custom fields"
        plugin for this feature to work. This plugin is installed and
        automatically activated when you install or update Akeeba
        Subscriptions.</para>
      </important>

      <para>One of the most frequently requested features in Akeeba
      Subscriptions has been the customisation of the fields shown in the
      subscription page. Traditionally, this has been possible only by
      creating specialised Joomla! plugins. For all the merits of custom
      plugins, there was always one major drawback: it takes a developer to
      create them, making it impossible for non-developer site owners and
      integrators to add custom fields. Not any more! The Custom Fields
      feature of Akeeba Subscriptions allows you to easily create simple
      fields, such as text boxes and selection lists, using a simple graphical
      user interface. The custom fields are stored per user and shown in
      Akeeba Subscriptions' <guilabel>Users</guilabel> page.</para>

      <para>You can access this feature by clicking on the Custom Fields
      toolbar link.</para>

                a one-of-many selection field using vertically stacked radio
                buttons. Ideal for selecting between a few, described in great
                length, options. You can define the available options in the

              <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Date</emphasis>. Creates a date
                picker field. The user will be able to type in a date or
                select a date using the standard Joomla! pop-up date
                picker.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Subscription options</emphasis>.
                This creates a drop-down with subscription options. This works
                like the "Drop-down" field type, with two very important
                difference: each option can increase or decrease the net price
                and the duration (length in days) of the subscription.</para>

                <para>For example, a local footbal club could offer a
                "supporter" membership which costs 200 Euros annually. If the
                subscriber wants access to cheaper tickets they want an extra
                fee of 20 Euros per year. Without "Subscription options" you'd
                need to create two subscription levels, one without access to
                cheaper tickets for 200 Euros and one with cheaper tickets for
                220 Euros. With "Subscription options" you can create only one
                subscription level for 200 Euros with a custom field for
                access to cheaper tickets. The field allows the subscriber to
                select between no access (no additional charge) or with access
                (extra charge of 20 Euros).</para>

                <para>Another example is having the same kind of subscription,
                e.g. access to a local newspaper, with three different
                subscription lengths: 1 month, 6 months, 1 year. Traditionally
                you'd need to create three subscription levels, one for each
                length. Using a Subscription Options custom field you can
                create only one level with a duration of 180 days (i.e. 6
                months) and create three entries in the Subscription Options
                field with duration modifiers of -150 days (180 days minus 150
                days = 30 days, i.e. one month) and 185 days (180 days plus
                185 days is 265 days, i.e. a year).</para>

                <important>
                  <para>This field type is a per-subscription option. Unlike
                  other custom fields (which are per-user options) it's not
                  saved in the User profile. It is kept in the subscription
                  record and you will need to use the [SUBCUSTOM:slug_name]
                  tag to access its contents in invoices, emails and
                  messages.</para>
                </important>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>
          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

        <varlistentry>
          <term>Options</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Its function depends on the field type:</para>

            <itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Text and password box</emphasis>.
                Anything you type in here will be shown as a placeholder (gray
                text which disappears when you start typing) inside the
                box.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Checkbox</emphasis>. Anything you
                type in Options is ignored.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Everything else</emphasis>. For
                all other field types this is how you define options and their
                labels. The format is VALUE=LABEL, on pair per line. For
                example:</para>

                <programlisting>1=One
10=Ten
100=A hundred
1000=A thousand</programlisting>

                <para>With the example above, a drop=down list would show you
                the options One, Ten, A hundred and A thousand. The value
                stored, depending on your selection, would be 1, 10, 100 or
                1000.</para>

                <para>To make it clear: Each line defines one option to be
                shown to the user. Anything to the left of the equals sign is
                saved in the database and is made available to you when you
                display the contents of the field. Anything to the right of
                the equals sign is what your subscriber sees in the
                subscription page.</para>

                <para>If you want to translate the label (right hand part) of
                the options you can use a language constant as described in
                our <link linkend="custom-fields-translation">translation
                instructions</link> below.</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para><emphasis role="bold">Subscription options</emphasis>.
                It works pretty much the same was as "Everything else"
                described above. The only difference is what comes to the
                right hand of the equals sign. Each line follows the
                convention VALUE=LABEL|PRICE|DAYS. For example:</para>

                <programlisting>1=Normal price
2=Cheaper, one month shorter|-9.99|-30
3=More expensive, one month longer|9.99|30
4=Invalid, same as the normal price|foobar
5=More expensive, same duration|9.99
6=Cheaper, but same length|-9.99|foobar
7=Same price, one month longer|0|30</programlisting>

                <para>That pretty much means that after the label you are
                expected to put a vertical bar (|) followed by the amount of
                money you want to add/remove from the subscription's net
                price, optionally followed by one more vertical bar (|)
                followed by the amount of time, in days, you want to
                add/remove from the subscription's duration.</para>

                <para>In this example, if someone chooses the "Normal price"
                option the net price will be left unchanged because we did not
                define an amount for the option.</para>

                <para>Conversely if the choose "Cheaper, one month shorter"
                they will be charged 9.99 <emphasis>less</emphasis> because
                the value after the vertical bar is negative. Since this is
                followed by |-30 the subscription will be shorter by 30
                days.</para>

                <para>If they choose "More expensive, one month longer" they
                will be charged 9.99 <emphasis>more</emphasis> because the
                value after the vertical bar is positive. Moreover, as this is
                followed by |30 the subscription will also be longer by 30
                days.</para>

                <para>If they chose "More expensive, same duration" would be
                charged 9.99 <emphasis>more</emphasis> because the value after
                the vertical bar is positive. Since this is not followed by a
                subscription length modifier, the subscription's length would
                remain intact. This solution is useful e.g. in conferences
                when you want to allow people to also pay for an add-on event
                such as a dinner.</para>

                <para>If they chose "Same price, one month longer" they will
                pay the same price, because the price modifier is 0. However,
                the subscription length will be longer by 30 days. Honestly,
                we have no idea why someone would possibly want such a setup,
                but if you actually do need it it's there for you to
                use.</para>

                <para>If they choose "Invalid" the price will not be modified
                because the value after the vertical bar is not a number and
                Akeeba Subscriptions has no idea what you want it to do. This
                makes the field equivalent to a regular Drop-Down custom field
                and doesn't make much sense.</para>

                <para>Finally, the "Cheaper, but same length" has a valid
                price modified (-9.99) which means that the subscriber will
                pay less, but the subscription length modifier is not a number
                and will be totally ignored.</para>

        <title>Accessing custom fields data</title>

        <para>Custom fields can be accessed like any other custom field
        throughout the component. Whenever our documentation is talking about
        the field name's it means the Slug you have entered in the custom
        field edit page. Below you can find the most common uses.</para>

        <bridgehead>Subscription Levels</bridgehead>

        <para>You can use custom field data in a Subscription Level's sign-up
        and cancellation messages. Assuming that your custom field's slug is
        my_field you can use the merge tag <option>[CUSTOM:MY_FIELD]</option>
        to access your custom field's contents. Please note that despite the
        case (lower or upper case) you've used for the slug you have to type
        the merge tag in all uppercase letters.</para>

        <bridgehead>Subscription and administrator emails</bridgehead>

        <para>In both the "Akeeba Subscriptions - Emails" and "Akeeba
        Subscriptions - Administrator Emails" plugins it's possible to
        customise the email messages sent to users and administrators
        respectively. Assuming that your custom field's slug is my_field you
        can use the merge tag <option>[CUSTOM:MY_FIELD]</option> to access
        your custom field's contents. Please note that despite the case (lower
        or upper case) you've used for the slug you have to type the merge tag
        in all uppercase letters.</para>

        <bridgehead>ccInvoices Tags</bridgehead>

        <para>If you are using our "ccInvoices - Akeeba Subscriptions merge
        tags" plugin it's possible to access the value of custom fields for
        use in your invoices. Assuming that your custom field's slug is
        my_field you can use the merge tag
        <option>{asuser_custom_<replaceable>my_field</replaceable>}</option>
        to access your custom field's contents. Please note that despite the
        case (lower or upper case) you've used for the slug you have to type
        the merge tag in all lowercase letters.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="custom-fields-translation">
        <title>Localising (translating) custom fields' labels and
        options</title>

        <para>It is possible to use "language constants" instead of plain
        words in titles and option values. A "language constant" is an
        arbitrary string consisting of uppercase English characters and
        underscores. It doesn't have to mean anything. It's just a
        placeholder. You will assign a meaning to each language constant later
        on. This is a language constant: THIS_IS_A_LANGUAGE_CONSTANT. This is
        also a language constant:
        COM_AKEEBASUBS_MYCUSTOMFIELDS_FOOBAR_TITLE.</para>

        <tip>
          <para>As a rule of thumb, we recommend using the naming convention
          COM_AKEEBASUBS_USERCUSTOMFIELD_<replaceable>FIELDNAME</replaceable>_TITLE
          for field title language constant and
          COM_AKEEBASUBS_USERCUSTOMFIELD_<replaceable>FIELDNAME</replaceable>_OPTION_<replaceable>OPTIONNAME</replaceable>
          for field option language constants, where
          <replaceable>FIELDNAME</replaceable> is the field's slug in all
          uppercase letters and <replaceable>OPTIONNAME</replaceable> is a
          shorthand for the name of the option.</para>

          <para>Likewise, we suggest using
          COM_AKEEBASUBS_USERCUSTOMFIELD_<replaceable>FIELDNAME</replaceable>_LABEL_VALID
          and
          COM_AKEEBASUBS_USERCUSTOMFIELD_<replaceable>FIELDNAME</replaceable>_LABEL_INVALID
          for the Valid Field Label and Invalid Field Label language
          constants.</para>

          <para>While it is not mandatory to follow this convention, it makes
          translation much easier as the key name provides
          <emphasis>context</emphasis> to your translators, e.g. it tells them
          that they are translating the field title for such and such user
          defined custom field in Akeeba Subscriptions.</para>
        </tip>

        <para>And now, the interesting part: assigning a localised message per
        language constant and site language. Using Joomla! 2.5 and later it is
        easy, using its <guilabel>Language Override</guilabel> feature. Log
        into your site's back-end and go to <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>,
        <guisubmenu>Language Manager</guisubmenu>, then click on
        <guimenuitem>Overrides</guimenuitem>. Right above the list, on the
        right-hand side, there is a drop down. Select your desired language,
        e.g. <guilabel>English (United Kingdom) - Site</guilabel>.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Make sure you select the "- Site" variant of your
          language.</para>
        </important>

        <para>Click on the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button. In the new page,
        type the language constant in the <guilabel>Language
        constant</guilabel> field. Then enter the translation in the
        <guilabel>Text</guilabel> field. Then make sure you tick the
        <guilabel>For both locations</guilabel> checkbox. Finally click on the
        <guibutton>Save &amp; Close</guibutton> button to save your language
        override. Repeat those steps for each language on your site and your
        fields' labels will be localised.</para>

      <note>
        <para>This feature is only available in the for-a-fee Akeeba
        Subscriptions Professional edition. It is not available in the free of
        charge Core edition.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Since Akeeba Subscriptions 3.0.0 we offer an integrated invoicing
      feature in Akeeba Subscriptions. This allows you to automatically issue
      invoices to your subscribers when their subscription is paid for,
      without using a third party component or service.</para>

      <para>The invoices are issued against an HTML template and converted
      automatically to PDF. The PDF file can either be sent to the subscriber
      automatically or you can (re-)send it manually.</para>

      <para>The integrated invoicing is NOT enabled by default. If you want to
      enable it you have to publish the Akeeba Subscriptions - Integrated
      Invoicing plugin in Joomla!'s Plugin Manager page.</para>

      <para>Invoices generated by Akeeba Subscriptions' integrated invoicing
      will be available for download, as PDF files, in the My Subscriptions
      page at the front-end of the component.</para>

      <bridgehead>Security considerations</bridgehead>

      <para>All invoices' PDF files are stored in the
      <filename>administrator/components/com_akeebasubs/invoices</filename>
      directory. The directory comes with a .htaccess and web.config file
      which instructs Apache and IIS web servers respectively to forbid direct
      access to this directory files. Furthermore it comes with a blank
      index.html file which will prevent other web servers from producing a
      file listing in the directory. The names of the files are deliberately
      "mangled" using slightly hard to predict, semi-random names which will
      prevent malicious users from "guessing" their names and accessing them
      directly on web servers other than Apache and IIS.</para>

        <para>The Invoice Templates allow you to define how the invoices which
        are issued through the integrated invoicing feature will look like.
        You can create a different invoice template for each subscription
        level, business registration country and/or country if you want. All
        invoices share the same numbering unless you explicitly specify
        otherwise in an invoice template. Each invoice template can be
        unpublished. An unpublished invoice template will not be taken into
        account when invoices are being created.</para>

              whenever possible specify the exact width and height of each

        <important>
          <para>Signed PDFs can only be produced using the Integrated
          Invoicing feature of Akeeba Subscriptions. Even though other

          Subscriptions CAN NOT sign them for you because it does not control
          their creation.</para>
        </important>

        <tip>
          <para>If you have a business based in Greece you MUST generate
          signed PDF files for your invoices to be considered legally valid.
          Akeeba Subscriptions Professional is the first Joomla! invoicing
          component to offer this feature.</para>
        </tip>

        <para>We decided to devote an entire section to this slightly hidden
        but very useful feature of Akeeba Subscriptions: its ability to
        produce signed PDFs. But first, let's explain what signed PDFs are and
        why you might need them.</para>

        <bridgehead>What are signed PDFs?</bridgehead>

        <para>Signed PDFs are regular PDF files which carry a "signature". The
        signature is a cryptographically secured "snapshot" of the PDF file
        which proves a. who created it and b. that the PDF file has not been
        tampered with. It's the same thing as the stamp or handwritten
        signature you'd put on a physical (paper) invoice. In fact, in most
        jurisdictions it has the same legal status as a handwritten signature.
        All European Union countries equate the presence of a digital
        signature to a handwritten signature for all legal purposes. In Greece
        you are actually obliged to digitally sign your invoices (unless they
        are issued on perforated autographic paper or carry a signature by a
        "tax device"), otherwise they are considered illegal and punishable by
        law.</para>

        <para>The digital signature is issued against an X.509 certificate,
        also known as SSL certificate. This may sound familiar if you have set
        up HTTPS on your site, because you had to buy and install an "SSL
        certificate" on your server. In fact, we're talking about almost the
        same thing. Your server needed a special form of an SSL certificate
        which is valid only for HTTPS communications. You can't use it for
        signing PDF files. You can, however, get a different kind of "SSL
        certificate" (properly called an X.509 certificate) for signing
        e-mails (also known as "S/MIME") and PDF files. As a rule of thumb,
        any SSL certificate which can be used to sign e-mails (sometimes
        called an "S/MIME certificate" or a "digital identity") can usually be
        used to sign PDF files.</para>

        <bridgehead>How do I get a certificate for signing PDF
        files?</bridgehead>

        <para>As you may know, you can either create self-signed certificates
        or obtain a certificate from a commercial entity known as "Certificate
        Authority". There's a catch: you cannot prove the authenticity of
        self-signed certificates (anybody can create one), therefore signature
        issued against them are not legally accepted unless you are a
        certificate authority yourself. In case you are wondering if you are a
        certificate authority: no you aren't. If you were you'd definitely
        know it. So, you have to obtain a certificate from a reputable
        Certificate Authority. Why? The Certificate Authority (or CA for
        short) will "sign" your certificate with their own. Think about your
        certificate being your passport, the Certificate Authority being your
        government and their certificate being the official seal of the state.
        If someone presents you something which looks like a passport but
        lacks the seal (stamp) of the government you can't trust that what is
        written on the passport is true. However, if the passport is sealed by
        the government you do trust it. In fact, you trust the government well
        enough to believe that they've checked the personal information of the
        other party, commit it on the passport and seal it with their official
        seal. Your trust for the government extends to trusting that the
        government-certified identity of the other party is his real identity.
        That's how a CA works. They will check your identity, commit it to
        your passport (certificate) and seal it with their stamp (their own
        certificate).</para>

        <para>Making matters a little more complicated, most CAs issue three
        different kind of certificates: Class 1, Class 2 and Class 3. Class 3
        is reserved for their resellers and other CAs. It's the kind of
        certificate you don't need. So, what is the difference between Class 1
        and Class 2?</para>

        <para>Class 1 is the lowest class of certificates. In order to get a
        Class 1 certificate you only need a valid e-mail address (and,
        possibly, a small amount of money for the CA's trouble of issuing a
        certificate). No personal / business information is checked. The only
        proof provided by this kind of certificate is that the signer (that's
        you) has or had access to the email address specified in the
        certificate. Even though you can produce signed PDFs with Class 1
        certificates they are not automatically equivalent to a hand-written
        signature but may be acceptable in court in case of a dispute.</para>

        <para>Class 2 is the certificate class you will most likely need. For
        a Class 2 certificate to be issued the CA will have to validate your
        personal and/or business information. They will charge you a small or
        big sum of money for this service. This class of certificates proves
        that the signature belongs to the person or business that the CA
        validated the identity of. Signatures issued against Class 2
        certificates have legal standing equivalent to handwritten
        signatures.</para>

        <para>Below you can find a short list of Certificate Authorities we
        have tested:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><link
            xlink:href="http://www.comodo.com/home/email-security/free-email-certificate.php">Comodo</link>.
            They offer free Class 1 certificates. All you need is an email
            address.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><link
            xlink:href="http://www.symantec.com/verisign/digital-id">Verisign</link>.
            They offer Class 1 certificates for a small fee (about $23 USD per
            year).</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><link
            xlink:href="https://www.startssl.com/">StartSSL</link>. They offer
            free Class 1 certificates and low cost (about 50€ per year) Class
            2 certificates.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>You might wonder why you might want to pay Verisign for a Class
        1 certificate when the others give it away for free. There is yet
        another catch (of course!). Adobe Reader, the only application which
        can display digital signatures in PDF files, will display the status
        of an otherwise valid signature as UNKNOWN unless the certificate used
        for signing belongs to one of Adobe's partners (namely, if the CA is
        part of the <link
        xlink:href="http://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/approved-trust-list2.html">Adobe
        Approved Trust List</link>). Verisign seems to be the only
        English-speaking company which belongs to that list and can issue
        certificates is software format. Please note that many CAs will issue
        their certificates in the form of "USB tokens". These cannot be used
        in a server environment, like that used by your web server, therefore
        cannot be used with Akeeba Subscriptions.</para>

        <bridgehead>How do I use my certificate with Akeeba
        Subscriptions?</bridgehead>

        <para>Most CAs will issue your certificate and install it on your
        browser. This is acceptable if you only need to sign email you send
        from that browser and/or computer, but it's of little to no use when
        you want to automatically sign the PDF files issued by Akeeba
        Subscriptions. Luckily, you can export your certificates! Your CA
        should be able to give you instructions. They usually call this
        procedure "backing up" or "exporting" your certificates.</para>

        <para>Some information on exporting certificates on popular operating
        systems:</para>

            (Vista and later)</link>. Remember to select the "Yes, export the
            private key" option.</para>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>Now, there's a world of pain out there. Certificates can be
        exported in many different and largely incompatible formats. In order
        for Akeeba Subscriptions to be able to use your certificate it must be
        exported in PEM format. Files in PEM format have the extensions .pem,
        .cer or .crt depending on your browser and operating system. If your
        operating system doesn't allow you to export directly to PEM format,
        you may have to convert your file (usually in PKCS#12 a.k.a. .pfx
        format) to PEM format using something like <link xlink:href="???">SSL
        Converter</link>. Once you export the certificate, rename the file to
        certificate.cer (all lowercase letters) and upload it to your site's
        <uri>administrator/components/com_akeebasubs/assets/tcpdf/certificates</uri>
        directory.</para>

        <para>A certificate is actually a collection of two things: a public
        key and a private key. Akeeba Subscriptions needs both to sign your
        PDF files. Usually both keys are included when you export your
        certificate. If you have to export them separately, remember to also
        export your secret key in PEM format (.pem, .cer or .crt file
        extension), rename it to secret.cer and upload it to your site's
        <uri>administrator/components/com_akeebasubs/assets/tcpdf/certificates</uri>
        directory.</para>

        <para>The secret key of your certificate is always password-protected.
        This is what prevents someone from grabbing a copy of your certificate
        and impersonate you. Therefore, Akeeba Subscriptions needs you to
        enter the password of this file in its configuration. Go to the
        back-end of your site and go to <guimenu>Components</guimenu>,
        <guimenuitem>Akeeba Subscriptions</guimenuitem> and click on the
        <guibutton>Options</guibutton> button in the toolbar. Under
        <guilabel>Invoicing</guilabel> you will find the option for the
        certificate secret key password. Enter your password there.</para>

        invoices!</para>

      <title>Customising Akeeba Subscriptions</title>

      <para>The author has no illusions about being any good as a web
      designer. The opposite is true. To this end, we've made it very easy for
      users to override the CSS files of Akeeba Subscriptions in their

      Subscriptions' front-end display.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Customising the front-end layout</title>

        <para>Layout customisation usually involves either changing just the
        CSS or changing both the CSS and HTML output of the component. Both
        can be accomplished with template overrides. We will explain the two
        procedures below.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>Newer versions of the component may introduce changes to the
          base CSS files and HTML output. We recommend you to review your
          overridden files every time you upgrade Akeeba Subscriptions. We
          regret to inform you that we can not accept bug reports and support
          requests unless the issues you have can be reproduced <emphasis>even
          after disabling your overrides</emphasis>.</para>
        </warning>

          <step>
            <para>Find your current template's subdirectory in your site's
            root, under the <filename>tempates</filename> directory. In this
            example, we will assume it is
            <filename>templates/<replaceable>mytemplate</replaceable></filename></para>
          </step>

          <step>
            <para>Create a new directory

        <bridgehead>Customising the HTML output</bridgehead>

        <para>Sometimes it's not enough modifying the CSS. In order to achieve
        your desired styling you may also have to add some extra div or span
        elements in the HTML output. When this happens you need to perform
        template overrides for our view template PHP files, a process called
        Template Overrides in Joomla! jargon. Instead of reinventing the wheel
        by writing lengthy instructions, we think it's better for you to read
        the <link

        <para>There are two ways to customise your email messages, depending

        for-a-fee Professional edition.</para>

        <bridgehead>Akeeba Subscriptions Professional</bridgehead>

        <para>Akeeba Subscriptions Professional has a full-featured e-mail
        template editor discussed in the <link

        of the email messages.</para>

        <bridgehead>Akeeba Subscriptions Core</bridgehead>

        <para>Akeeba Subscriptions Core lacks the visual email editor of the
        Professional version but it does allow you to customise your email
        messages. In order to do that you have to override the translation
        strings which define the email subject and body in each of its
        email-capable plugins. Traditionally this required editing files on
        your server but thanks to a feature introduced in Joomla! 2.5 this is
        no longer necessary. Here's how to edit your emails text using Joomla!
        2.5 and later's Language Override's feature. Log into your site's
        back-end and go to <guimenu>Extensions</guimenu>,
        <guimenuitem>Language Manager</guimenuitem>, then click on
        <guilabel>Overrides</guilabel>. Right above the list, on the
        right-hand side, there is a drop down. Select your desired language,
        e.g. <option>English (United Kingdom) - Administrator</option>.</para>

        <important>
          <para>Make sure you select the "- Administrator" variant of your
          language. Counter-intuitively, plugin translation files are
          considered administrator language files.</para>
        </important>

        <para>Click on the <guibutton>New</guibutton> button. In the new page,
        in the right-hand side of the page, there is a search box. Enter a
        part of the email text you want to translate. For example, let's
        change the email header of a new (just-paid) subscription. We will
        search for <replaceable>new subscription</replaceable>. Make sure the
        radio button called <guilabel>Value</guilabel> is selected and click
        on <guibutton>Search</guibutton>. After 1-5 seconds, a list of
        matching language strings is shown below. You can use the
        <guilabel>More results</guilabel> link to load more language
        strings.</para>

        <para>The email language strings begin with a different prefix
        depending on the plugin which sends them:</para>

        </variablelist>

        <para>In our case, we want to change the email header for the email
        sent to a subscriber when his subscription becomes active, so it is
        the <option>PLG_AKEEBASUBS_SUBSCRIPTIONEMAILS_HEAD_NEW_ACTIVE</option>
        option from the list. Click on it. Magically, the <guilabel>Language
        constant</guilabel> and <guilabel>Text</guilabel> fields on the
        left-hand side of the interface are populated.</para>

        <para>Brilliant! Now edit the text in the <guilabel>Text</guilabel>
        area to whatever you want. You can use <link
        linkend="message-variables">message variables</link> in the
        text.</para>

        <para>Then make sure you tick the <guilabel>For both
        locations</guilabel> checkbox. Finally click on the <guibutton>Save
        &amp; Close</guibutton> button to save your override. From now on,
        Joomla! will use your overridden translation string instead of
        <guilabel>Akeeba Subscriptions - Subscriptions Emails</guilabel>
        plugin's built-in strings. After setting up all those overrides, it's
        easy to train your client to edit those emails all by themselves,
        without your intervention.</para>

        <para>Akeeba Subscriptions allows you to customise the subscription
        level success and cancellation messages, as well as the emails it
        sends. Customisation would be futile without a way to include various
        bits of useful information regarding the subscription the message or
        email refers to. This is done through the use of message variables or
        "merge codes". You will find all of the currently available merge
        codes below:</para>

    <title>Payment plugins</title>

    <para>Akeeba Subscriptions is designed to be a modular system, powered by
    standard Joomla! plugins. Using plugins you can add payment methods as
    well as integration with third party software. Moreover, core
    functionality of Akeeba Subscriptions (like sending out emails upon
    subscription or email reminders for subscription expiration) is take care
    of by plugins.</para>

    <para>This documentation chapter will guide you through the details of
    configuring the payment plugins. Payment plugins are used to integrate
    payment processor (services which facilitate on-line and off-line
    payments) with Akeeba Subscriptions. Without them you cannot have
    subscriptions. Akeeba Subscriptions comes with dozens of payment plugins.
    One of them, which integrates the popular PayPal payments service, is
    always enabled by default.</para>

    <para>All payment methods are standard Joomla! plugins, belonging to the
    <option>akpayment</option> group. If you want to enable a payment method,
    just publish the relevant plugin.</para>

    <warning>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">EXTREMELY IMPORTANT! DO NOT SEEK SUPPORT IF
      YOU DO NOT HEED THIS WARNING.</emphasis></para>

      <para>ALL AKEEBA SUBSCRIPTIONS AND PAYMENT PLUGINS MUST BE PUBLISHED
      WITH "Public" ACCESS. IF YOU SET THEIR ACCESS TO "Registered" OR IN ANY
      OTHER WAY MODIFY YOUR SITE'S ACL SETTINGS TO FORBID NON LOGGED IN USERS
      FROM ACCESSING THE PLUGINS AKEEBA SUBSCRIPTIONS WILL WORK ERRATICALLY OR
      NOT AT ALL.</para>

      <para>If you think that Akeeba Subscriptions does not work correctly
      because it does not activate subscriptions, run integrations (e.g.
      doesn't assign subscribers to Joomla! groups), accept payments or
      malfunctions in any other way, the first you MUST do before even
      contemplating on whether you should contact us is to check your plugins.
      During the first week of June 2012 we had four people with the same
      self-induced problem. <emphasis role="bold">YOU MUST NEVER, EVER CHANGE
      THE ACCESS OF THE PLUGINS</emphasis>!</para>
    </warning>

    <bridgehead>Can I request a custom payment plugin?</bridgehead>

    <para>Generally yes, you can request the creation of a custom payment
    plugin. In order for us to do that there has to be an API for the payment
    processor available. If the API is not available to the general public you
    will have to provide it to us. You must also be willing to test it on a
    site of yours where we can also have access for debugging purposes.
    Usually a test or staging site will do just fine.</para>

    <para>The base price for creating a custom payment plugin is 600 Euros
    with a 50% deposit before we start working on it. The creation of a custom
    plugin takes between 2 and 8 weeks, depending on our workload. Please try
    to contact us at least two and a half months before your site is scheduled
    to go live to allow for adequate time to create and test the payment
    plugin.</para>

    <para>All integration plugins created are included in the next release of
    Akeeba Subscriptions. If you want a private plugin, i.e. a plugin that
    will not be included in the next release of Akeeba Subscriptions, there is
    an additional charge of 1000 Euros. Updates to your private plugin are
    quoted per case, with a minimum fee of 300 Euros. The private surcharge
    and update fee are paid in advance, before we start doing any work. Bug
    fixes are provided free of charge for the first three (3) months.</para>

    <para>When we have the plugin in a usable state we will ask you to test
    it, using our latest development build ("dev release"). If you do not find
    any issues or do not reply at all within a week we will send you a
    proforma invoice. Upon payment of the balance of your account via bank
    transfer we will issue the final invoice.</para>

    <para>The prices above do not include VAT 18%. If you are outside the
    European Union you do not have to pay VAT. If you have an EU business with
    a VIES-registered VAT number you do not have to pay any VAT due to the
    reverse charge VAT system in the Eurozone. This exemption does not apply
    to residents and businesses of the Republic of Cyprus; all Cypriot
    residents and businesses are charged VAT.</para>

    <para>We reserve the right to decline the creation of a custom payment
    plugin due to technical reasons; high workload which would make it
    impossible to deliver on time; or force majeur. We try our best to let you
    know as soon as you contact us with your request. In the unlikely event
    that we have to cancel the plugin creation after accepting the work order
    we will refund in full any deposit you made with us.</para>

      <para>This payment method integrates the 2Checkout Standard Purchase
      Routine payments service (commonly simply referred to as 2checkout or
      2CO). This plugin uses the "pass-through-products" parameters set for
      communicating with 2Checkout, allowing it to support recurring and
      non-recurring payments. Moreover, unlike the other 2Checkout
      integration, it does automatically pass the currency to

      <bridgehead>Recurring payments support notes</bridgehead>

      <para>2Checkout has some restrictions regarding the renewal period of
      subscription. A subscription may recur in a period measured in weeks,
      months or years. Akeeba Subscriptions will automatically convert the
      subscription duration to the closest match. This may not always be what
      you expect. For example, 180 days is converted to 6 months and 15 days
      is converted to 2 weeks. Due to the fuzziness of the conversion and the
      way 2Checkout handles renewals, it is possible that a subscription will
      expire before it is automatically renewed. If a subscription expires, an
      expiration email will be sent to your client.</para>

      <para>For example, a 90 days subscription will recur every 3 months. If
      a subscription was made on June 1st, 2Checkout will renew it on
      September 1st. That's 92 days. This means that the 90 days subscription
      period ends on August 30th. Between that and September 1st the
      subscription will be expired. As a result we recommend setting up
      subscriptions as multiples of 31 days to get the correct number of
      months, or multiples of 366 days to get the correct number of years,
      e.g. 62 days for a 2 month subscription or 732 days for a 2 year
      subscription.</para>

      <para>Payments will recur till the end of the world unless you cancel
      your 2Checkout account, your client manually unsubscribes through
      2Checkout or your client does not have funds when his renewal is due. In
      all of the above cases, your client's subscription may expire before it
      is renewed. If a subscription expires, an expiration email will be sent
      to your client.</para>

      <para>You can not cancel recurring payments through Akeeba
      Subscriptions. You have to do so manually, from 2Checkout's
      back-end.</para>

      <important>
        <para>Not all payment processors allow programmatic cancellation of
        subscriptions, e.g. PayPal. As a result we cannot implement a feature
        that doesn't actually work with all recurring payment providers,
        especially if it doesn't work with the most popular one. That would
        cause a lot of frustration to our users and their clients, as well as
        increase our support load for no good reason. Please do not request
        such a feature; we are not considering implementing it.</para>
      </important>

      <para>When a subscription payment recurs, the original subscription
      record is overwritten. In order for you not to lose statistics
      information, a new <emphasis role="bold">expired</emphasis> subscription
      record is created with the old subscription record's information. This
      means that the subscription with the biggest subscription ID (appearing
      towards the top of the front- and back-end lists) will show as expired.
      This is not a bug. 2Checkout sends us the original subscription's ID as
      a reference, which is why only the original subscription can be
      updated.</para>

      <bridgehead renderas="sect4">Setting up the product in Akeeba
      Subscriptions</bridgehead>

      <para>First create a subscription level and note down its title. For the
      sake of this example let's say it is called LEVEL1. Then perform the
      procedure above to get the product's # auth, e.g. 11111/22222/33333. You
      need to enter the following line in the Map price-points field in Akeeba
      Subscriptions:</para>

      <programlisting>LEVEL1=11111/22222/33333</programlisting>

      <para>If you want to set up multiple levels, you can enter one level per
      line. For example, in order to map a second subscription level called
      LEVEL2 to the same Allopass product enter this:</para>

      <programlisting>LEVEL1=11111/22222/33333
LEVEL2=11111/22222/33333</programlisting>

      <para>We are not through yet. We also need to enter the API keys. Go to
      your Allopass My Profile page. On the right hand side you will find the
      API Key and API Secret Key. Copy those keys to Akeeba Subscriptions
      plugin's same-named fields. Now save the plugin, publish it and you're
      ready to start selling.</para>

            is worth in your defined currency.</para>

            <para>This is easier to understand with an example. Let's say that
            the currency you have set up in Akeeba Subscriptions is Euros. If
            you have a subscription level which costs 12 Euros then Akeeba
            Subscriptions will normally consume 12 AlphaUserPoints for the
            subscription purchase. Now let's change the exchange rate to
            <option>10</option>. In this case Akeeba Subscriptions will
            consume 1.2 AlphaUserPoints. If the exchange rate was set to 20
            then Akeeba Subscriptions would consume only 0.6 AlphaUserPoints
            for this transaction.</para>

      <bridgehead>Integration notes for recurring payments</bridgehead>

      <para>In order to get recurring payments work with BrainTree, the
      merchant has to create a "plan" in the braintree account, that matches
      the Akeeba Subscriptions' Subscription Level. When ones create a plan
      (in the BrainTree account under <guimenu>Recurring Billing</guimenu>,
      <guimenuitem>Plans</guimenuitem>) there are a few fields to fill in. The
      first field is called <guilabel>Plan ID</guilabel> and the merchant has
      to enter the "slug" of the corresponding Subscription Level of Akeeba
      Subscriptions. There are also the fields <guilabel>Price</guilabel>
      which will be overwritten by the amount sent by Akeeba Subscriptions and
      <guilabel>First Bill Date</guilabel> will always be set to
      <option>Immediately</option> by the plugin. One can only choose the
      billing cycle in months, so that has to match the <guilabel>Subscription
      Length</guilabel> in Akeeba Subscriptions.</para>

      <important>
        <para>A calendar month can be up to 31 days. This means that your
        subscription length in Akeeba Subscriptions should be longer than the
        number of days equivalent to the number of calendar months of your
        billing period. The subscription level length should be (31 * n) + 1
        days, where n is the number of months of the billing period in
        BrainTree. For example, if you have a 3 month subscription its length
        should be 3 * 31 + 1 = 93 + 1 = 94 days. If the subscription length is
        smaller it is possible that the subscription expires before Akeeba
        Subscriptions receives the recurring payment. In this case your
        subscribers will receive an email notifying them that their
        subscription expired and a couple of days later another email telling
        them that the subscription became active again. This is something you
        certainly don't want to happen.</para>
      </important>

      <para>In order to get recurring payments to work one secondly has to
      create a "webhook" (under <guimenu>Account</guimenu>,
      <guimenuitem>Webhooks</guimenuitem> which notifies Akeeba Subscriptions
      about changes (e.g. new payment) of a recurring subscription. The URL
      that needs to be used for the webhook is:</para>

      <para><uri>https://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_akeebasubs&amp;view=callback&amp;paymentmethod=braintree&amp;type=webhook&amp;marker=000</uri>
      after replacing <uri>www.example.com</uri> with your site's domain
      name.</para>

      <para>and one has to select to get a notification for
      <option>Subscription charged successfully</option>.</para>

      <para>The first one is the "Payment page". Unfortunately, this can not
      be provided, as the referrer page (where the client performs the payment
      from) depends on your menu structure and the subscription level your
      user buys. If they insist, give them this URL:</para>

      <para><uri>http://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_akeebasubs&amp;view=subscribe</uri></para>

      <para>Where www.example.com is the domain name of your site. If this
      doesn't work and ask you to contact your web developer to change the
      payment system, we regret to inform you that this IS NOT AN OPTION.
      Besides, the bank checking the HTTP referer field for "security reasons"
      (as they say in their documentation) is stupid. This HTTP field can be
      forged very easily or even turned off (ref. <link
      xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec15.html">RFC
      2616 ch. 15.1.2 §7</link>) and must not be used for security purposes.
      Moreover, not allowing more than one payment URLs is unheard of in this
      decade. Please ask the bank to fix their system. After all, it's YOUR
      money on the line.</para>

      <para>The other three URLs they require are the Success, Failure and
      Cancel pages. For all of them give them this URL:</para>

      <para>There are two ways to confirm the payments made by your clients
      and activate subscriptions, the manual method and the automatic
      method.</para>

      <para>In the manual method you have to check for IFthen payments daily.
      Then you must go to your Subscriptions view, find the subscriptions
      which have been paid for an enable them by setting the payment status to
      "Completed". Please note that the IFthen reference number is displayed
      in the Processor Key field.</para>

      <para>The second method is an automatic call-back made by IFthen to your
      site when each payment is completed. This will allow Akeeba
      Subscriptions to enable paid subscriptions automatically. In order to
      use that you have to send an email to IFthen asking them to enable
      callbacks. In the email, you need to provide two pieces of
      information:</para>

      <para>This is a payment plugin which lets your users complete their
      payment off-line, e.g. through bank (wire) transfer, money check,
      Western Union or any other means of payment that you allow. It works
      very simply: it just presents your user with a customizable instructions
      message. In that message you can use the variables
      <replaceable>{SUBSCRIPTION}</replaceable> to display the subscription ID
      and <replaceable>{AMOUNT}</replaceable> to display the amount due. You
      can also use <replaceable>{FIRSTNAME}</replaceable> and

        embed a Flash file (even though I can't possibly think

        as long as it's allowed by your Joomla! version and preferences. It's

      <bridgehead>Recurring payments support notes</bridgehead>

      <para>PayPal has some restrictions regarding the renewal period of
      subscription. A subscription may recur in a period of 1-90 days, 1-52
      weeks, 1-24 months or 1-5 years. Akeeba Subscriptions will automatically
      convert the subscription duration to the closest match. This may not
      always be what you expect. For example, 180 days is converted to 6
      months and 15 days is converted to 2 weeks. Due to the fuzziness of the
      conversion and the way PayPal handles renewals, it is possible that a
      subscription will expire before it is automatically renewed. If a
      subscription expires, an expiration email will be sent to your
      client.</para>

      <para>Payments will recur till the end of the world unless you cancel
      your PayPal account, your client cancels his PayPal account, your client
      manually unsubscribes from his PayPal account's back-end or your client
      does not have funds for 3 consecutive days after his renewal is due. In
      all of the above cases, your client's subscription may expire before it
      is renewed. If a subscription expires, an expiration email will be sent
      to your client.</para>

      <para>You can not cancel recurring payments through Akeeba
      Subscriptions. You have to do so manually, from PayPal's
      back-end.</para>

      <important>
        <para>PayPal does not allow cancelling subscriptions / recurring
        payments programmatically. It's not like we are missing this feature
        in Akeeba Subscriptions; it's simply impossible with PayPal because
        PayPal does not support this feature at all.</para>
      </important>

      <para>When a subscription payment recurs, the original subscription
      record is overwritten. In order for you not to lose statistics
      information, a new <emphasis role="bold">expired</emphasis> subscription
      record is created with the old subscription record's information. This
      means that the subscription with the biggest subscription ID (appearing
      towards the top of the front- and back-end lists) will show as expired.
      This is not a bug. PayPal sends us the original subscription's ID as a
      reference, which is why only the original subscription can be
      updated.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>In order for the recurring payments to work you have to enter
        Akeeba Subscriptions' callback URL in PayPal's interface. Log in to

      <para>PayPal doesn't handle UTF-8 data very gracefully by default. You

      <para>Some people have reported that the subscriptions are not

      <bridgehead>Recurring payments support notes</bridgehead>

      <para>PayPal has some restrictions regarding the renewal period of
      subscription. A subscription may recur in a period of 1-90 days, 1-52
      weeks, 1-24 months or 1-5 years. Akeeba Subscriptions will automatically
      convert the subscription duration to the closest match. This may not
      always be what you expect. For example, 180 days is converted to 6
      months and 15 days is converted to 2 weeks. Due to the fuzziness of the
      conversion and the way PayPal handles renewals, it is possible that a
      subscription will expire before it is automatically renewed. If a
      subscription expires, an expiration email will be sent to your
      client.</para>

      <para>Payments will recur till the end of the world unless you cancel
      your PayPal account, your client cancels his PayPal account, your client
      manually unsubscribes from his PayPal account's back-end or your client
      does not have funds for 3 consecutive days after his renewal is due. In
      all of the above cases, your client's subscription may expire before it
      is renewed. If a subscription expires, an expiration email will be sent
      to your client.</para>

      <para>You can not cancel recurring payments through Akeeba
      Subscriptions. You have to do so manually, from PayPal's
      back-end.</para>

      <important>
        <para>PayPal does not allow cancelling subscriptions / recurring
        payments pro grammatically. It's not like we are missing this feature
        in Akeeba Subscriptions; it's simply impossible with PayPal because
        PayPal does not support this feature at all.</para>
      </important>

      <para>When a subscription payment recurs, the original subscription
      record is overwritten. In order for you not to lose statistics
      information, a new <emphasis role="bold">expired</emphasis> subscription
      record is created with the old subscription record's information. This
      means that the subscription with the biggest subscription ID (appearing
      towards the top of the front- and back-end lists) will show as expired.
      This is not a bug. PayPal sends us the original subscription's ID as a
      reference, which is why only the original subscription can be
      updated.</para>

      <warning>
        <para>In order for the recurring payments to work you have to enter
        Akeeba Subscriptions' callback URL in PayPal's interface. Log in to

      <note>
        <para>There are two plugins available with Akeeba Subscriptions. The
        <guilabel>Akeeba Subscriptions Payment - SCNet</guilabel> plugin works
        by redirecting your customer to SCnet's website. All credit card entry
        and processing is done at SCnet's site. On the contrary, with the
        <guilabel>Akeeba Subscriptions Payment - SCNet (integrated)</guilabel>
        plugin the credit card form is rendered on your site. The customer
        never leaves your site. The credit card data is then sent to SCnet for
        processing. When using the "integrated" plugin you must use HTTPS on
        your site to ensure the security of the transactions. This precludes
        the use of the "integrated" plugin on shared hosts, where setting up
        HTTPS is usually out of the question or leads to suboptimal
        situations, like "shared HTTPS" setups which do not always satisfy PCI
        compliance guidelines.</para>

    <title>Integration plugins</title>

    <para>Akeeba Subscriptions is designed to be a modular system, powered by
    standard Joomla! plugins. Using plugins you can add payment methods as
    well as integration with third party software. Moreover, core
    functionality of Akeeba Subscriptions (like sending out emails upon
    subscription or email reminders for subscription expiration) is take care
    of by plugins.</para>

    <para>One of the most important aspects about subscription systems is
    their ability to integrate with third party software. A subscription all
    by itself means pretty much nothing. It's just a "flag". The added value
    is when this subscription allows the user holding it to actually do
    something on the site. Akeeba Subscriptions comes with several such
    plugins. One of them, integrating with Joomla! user groups (usually
    referred to as "ACL" - Access Control List - by experienced users), is
    enabled by default.</para>

    <para>As of Akeeba Subscriptions 3.0.0 and later versions most integration
    plugins have no options in the plugin editor. Instead, you will find their
    configuration inside each subscription level's page. This makes it much
    easier for you to understand how they work, without having to remember the
    complex syntax which was required in previous versions of Akeeba
    Subscriptions.</para>

    <para>All integrations with third party applications and services are
    standard Joomla! plugins, published in the <option>akeebasubs</option>
    group.</para>

    <bridgehead>Frequently asked question: I want to be able to add users to
    groups when their subscription expires</bridgehead>

    <para>Executive summary: this feature will never be implemented. It
    signifies a wrong ACL setup on your site and will mathematically lead to
    unintuitive behaviour that you will consider as a bug (even though the
    component will actually do exactly what you tell it to do). And now for
    the details.</para>

    <para>Joomla! ACLs are modelled after the Microsoft Windows ACL system. In
    this model the default behaviour is having no access to anything unless
    explicitly given. In essence, Joomla! user groups act as <emphasis>keys to
    doors</emphasis>. You can either have a key or you don't. If you have a
    key you can unlock the door. If you don't you can't go through that door.
    This is an oversimplified analogy but holds true for pretty much every
    correctly set up site.</para>

    <para>Some people don't understand that and end up with something like
    this. A group, let's call it Subscribers, which grants access privileges.
    Another group, let's call it Non Subscribers, denying access privileges.
    The second group is redundant and means that the ACL setup on that site is
    incorrect.</para>

    <para>Further to that, implementing a feature which would allow you to add
    users to groups when their subscription expires and remove users from
    groups when their subscription becomes active will lead to unintuitive
    behaviour. Remember that integration plugins run per user, not per
    subscription. All active and inactive subscriptions of the user are
    considered and the sum of all changes is applied to her account. This is
    what allows you to, say, change the user group assignments per
    subscription level and click on the Run Integrations button to apply them
    to all subscribers without having to manually edit each and every user
    account manually. Let's illustrate this with an example. Consider a site
    with the following subscription setup.</para>

    <para>SILVER:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Add on subscription: Silver Group</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Remove on subscription: Non-subscriber</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Add on expiration: Non-subscriber</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Remove on expiration: Silver Group</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>GOLD:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Add on subscription: Silver Group, Gold Group</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Remove on subscription: Non-subscriber</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Add on expiration: Non-subscriber</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Remove on expiration: Silver Group, Gold Group</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>This looks like a pretty straightforward setup, right?</para>

    <para>Let's consider a client named Alice. She buys a SILVER subscription.
    She is added to the Silver Group. Then her subscription expires. She is
    removed from the Silver Group and added to the Non-subscriber
    group.</para>

    <para>Two months later, Alice comes back to the site and buys a Gold
    subscription. You'd expect that she would be added to the Silver and Gold
    groups and removed from the Non-subscriber group, right? Well, wrong.
    Here's what happens. The add/remove groups being considered are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Remove from groups:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Silver Group (because of the expired SILVER
            subscription)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Non-subscriber (because of the new GOLD subscription)</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Add to groups:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Silver Group (because of the new GOLD subscription)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Gold Group (because of the new GOLD subscription)</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Non-subscriber (because of the expired SILVER
            subscription)</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>You obviously can't add and remove a user to the same group. If a
    group is both in the add and remove lists it is removed from both. If you
    have to give and remove a key at the same time, you get to do nothing. It
    makes sense, doesn't it? So what changes are we going to do to Alice's
    account? Simple: add her to the Gold Group. This means that she's now a
    member of the Gold Group and the Non-subscribers group (she was added to
    it when her SILVER subscription expires). The end result is that Alice
    paid for a subscription but she has no access.</para>

    <para>In so many words, software will do what you tell it to do, not what
    you meant it to do. Considering that the Non-subscribers group was a bad
    idea to begin with, we have summed up the exact reason such a feature will
    never, ever be implemented so please stop asking for it. Instead of asking
    us to give you a big gun to shoot your feet with please do try fixing your
    site's ACL setup. Just keep in mind the key analogy: user groups are keys;
    they are used to unlock doors; like keys, you can have them or you don't.
    It will take you probably an extra half a day in planning and save you
    months or years of frustration.</para>

    <para>For what is worth, yours truly (the lead developer of this
    component), had to design the user groups for our own site
    <emphasis>twice</emphasis>. My first try was a failed attempt using the
    "Non-subscriber" user group idea. It only took me a day to realise how bad
    and how nonsensical this ACL setup was. Learn from my mistakes and heed my
    advice.</para>

      Subscriptions - Community Builder Integration</guilabel></para>

      <para>This integration plugin allows you to add and remove users from
      Community Builder groups based on their subscription status. Moreover,
      it allows you to automatically authorize subscribers and deauthorize
      them when their subscriptions expires, essentially controlling their
      access to your Community Builder community based on their subscription
      status.</para>

      <para>Please note that this is a smart integration, exactly as described
      in the JUGA plugin in this documentation; instead of adding users when a
      subscription goes active and removing them when a subscription goes
      inactive, Akeeba Subscriptions plugins take a look at all of the user's
      active and inactive subscriptions and decide if the user should be added
      to or removed from Community Builder groups or
      authorized/deauthorized.</para>

      <para>The plugin has these options:</para>

      <variablelist>

          <listitem>

          </listitem>
        </varlistentry>

          <listitem>
            <para>Should this subscription level be automatically authorized?
            When a user has an active subscription to one of the levels with
            automatic authorization enabled, he will be marked as an
            authorized user who has read the terms of use in Community
            Builder, essentially allowing her to have access to the Community
            Builder community on your site.</para>
          </listitem>

            deauthorized? When a user no longer has an active subscription to

            be marked as an unauthorized user who has not read the terms of

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Executive summary: No. It is not possible.
      You must ask JomSocial's developers for such a

      <para>Long explanation: Akeeba Subscriptions is a subscriptions
      management component. It is NOT an access control component. We can only
      add/remove subscribers to Joomla! and extension-specific groups. The
      actual access control is supposed to be performed by Joomla! and/or the
      third party components. As long as JomSocial does not allow you to limit
      viewing/posting depending on a user's groups assignment you cannot apply
      any limits. Please do contact JomSocial and ask them to add such a
      feature. Do not ask us to develop such a feature: we can't, we won't and
      we will no longer answer this kind of questions. Thank you.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>This is a list for assigning subscription levels to Joomla!
            groups. When a user has an active subscription to the specified

          <listitem>
            <para>Likewise, this is the list of the Joomla! groups to remove a
            user from when his subscription to the specified level is no
            longer active. Do note that you can specify a different set of
            groups to remove the user from than the ones you are adding him

      <para>When deciding which groups to add users to / remove from, this
      plugin takes into account all of the user's active and expired
      subscriptions. If a user group ends up begging to both be removed from
      the user account and added to it add wins. That is to say that if an
      expired subscription tells us to remove a user from Group A and another
      one tells us to add the user to Group A then the plugin always decides
      to add the user to Group A.</para>

      <para>This plugin allows you to synchronise the information stored for

      enable Joomla!'s optional User Profiles plugin. The second and most
      important corollary is that all information kept by Akeeba Subscriptions
      for your subscribers, including custom fields, are automatically
      synchronised with the #__user_profiles table, making the accessible to
      third party extensions in a very easy to process form.</para>

      <title>Sample Fields</title>

      <para>Displayed in the Plugins Manager as: <guilabel>Akeeba
      Subscriptions - Sample Fields</guilabel></para>

      <para>Since Akeeba Subscriptions 1.0.0 it is possible to have custom
      fields in the subscription page by means of plugins. These fields are
      stored as JSON inside each user's <database>params</database> field in
      the <database>#__akeebasubs_users</database> table. Developers can
      easily create plugins to add as many fields as they want. The "Sample
      Fields" plugin is a demonstration of this feature which also acts as a
      self-documenting tutorial for developers. It adds two custom fields
      (Gender and Age Group).</para>

    <section xml:id="integration-autocity">
      <title>Automatic Country and City fill</title>

      <para>Displayed in the Plugins Manager as: <guilabel>Akeeba
      Subscriptions - Automatic Country and City fill</guilabel></para>

      <para>Since Akeeba Subscriptions 1.0.0 it is possible to have plugins
      which can override user information (e.g. name, address) and can also be
      notified when user's information is being saved. This allows for very
      advanced integrations. One possibility is to automatically fetch such
      information from external services and component, e.g. using a
      geolocation service or fetching user information from Community Builder,
      JomSocial, etc. The other possibility is to provide a "reverse
      integration", e.g. update Community Builder or JomSocial fields based on
      the information the user entered in the subscription page, essentially
      making the user believe that all of his information is managed in a
      single place.</para>

      <para>This particular plugin acts as a demonstration of this plugin
      system. It will query the user's IP address against the free hostip.info
      service and populate the country and city fields, unless the user has
      overridden them, i.e. he has bought another subscription in the
      past.</para>

      <important>
        <para>The hostip.info service usually returns only the Country for a
        particular IP. It will very rarely be able to provide the City. If you
        only see the Country being filled in do not worry; it's how the
        service works.</para>

    <section xml:id="integration-sql">
      <title>Custom SQL scripts</title>

      <para>Displayed in the Plugins Manager as: <guilabel>Akeeba
      Subscriptions - Custom SQL scripts</guilabel></para>

      <para>This plugin can run arbitrary SQL commands when a subscription
      becomes active or inactive. Please note that this plugin is very naive.
      For starters, it will run the SQL commands once for every active and
      inactive subscriptions it encounters. If you have two disabled
      subscriptions and five enabled subscriptions on a specific level it will
      run the deactivation SQL twice and the activation SQL five times.
      Moreover, the plugin fires: when a new subscription is created; when the
      subscription status changes for any reason (payment status changes,
      manual disable/enable, automatic enable/disable due to Valid From/To
      dates being reached) and when you click on the Run Integration
      button.</para>

      <para>In each subscription level's editor page you can define the SQL
      commands to run. In all cases, you can do something like this:</para>

      <programlisting>INSERT INTO #__foobar (`user_id`,`something`) VALUES( '<replaceable>[USERID]</replaceable>', 'myvalue' );</programlisting>

      <para>It is the list of SQL commands, separated by semicolons. The
      <replaceable>[USERID]</replaceable> variable will be replaced with the
      user's numeric ID for the user whose subscription Akeeba Subscriptions
      is currently processing. The [USERNAME] variable will be replaced with
      the user's username (available since Akeeba Subscriptions 2.1).</para>

      synchronise its extra fields with CB. In order to do that you will have
      to create CB fields with their name being cb_ followed by the Akeeba
      Subscription's field slug. For example, if you have defined an Akeeba
      Subscriptions fields whose slug is mobile you need to create a CB field
      whose slug is cb_mobile for the sync to work.</para>

      <bridgehead>How is this all supposed to work in real life?</bridgehead>

      <para>The flow is very simple: the user comes to your site and clicks
      the Subscribe menu item. He fills in his information and clicks on
      Subscribe Now. He's forwarded to the payment processor's page (e.g.
      PayPal) and pays. When his payment is cleared, the payment processor
      calls back your site. Akeeba Subscriptions handles the callback and
      enables the subscription. Enabling the subscription triggers the "Akeeba
      Subscriptions - Intellectual Property integration" plugin. The plugin
      adds the user as an Agent to IP. At the same time, the email plugin is
      triggered and send the user an email which tells him that his
      subscription is now activated. Your user can begin filing properties on
      your site.</para>

      <para>When a subscription expires and has not been renewed, the "Akeeba
      Subscriptions - Intellectual Property integration" plugin is triggered
      again. This time it removes the user from Intellectual Property. At the
      same time, the email plugin is triggered and send the user an email
      which tells him that his subscription has now expired. Your user can no
      longer file new or manage his existing properties on your site.</para>

      <para>The exact limits for the Intellectual Property agent are defined
      by the plugin's setup parameters. In the setup parameters you actually
      tell the plugin what are the limits imposed by each subscription level.
      You can have, for example, two levels. LEVEL1 can tell the plugin that
      the user can create up to 10 properties, LEVEL2 can tell the plugin that
      the user can create up to 20 properties. If the user subscribes only to
      LEVEL1 he will be able to create up to 10 properties. If the user
      subscribes only to LEVEL2 he will be able to create up to 20 properties.
      If the user subscribes to both, he will be able to create up to 20
      properties (the largest value wins, the values are not added).</para>

      Subscriptions - Content Publishing</guilabel></para>

      <para>This integration plugin allows you to automatically publish
      content owned by a user when his subscription is activated and unpublish
      it when his subscription expires. The plugin works with Joomla!
      articles, K2 items, SobiPro 1.1+ entries and ZOO items. The idea is that
      when a subscription becomes enabled all items owned (authored) by the
      user are published. When the subscription expires, all of those items
      are automatically unpublished.</para>

      <note>
        <para>If you plan on using this plugin to control the publishing of
        SobiPro items you must use SobiPro 1.1 or later. SobiPro 1.0.x will
        NOT work.</para>

      <para>When a user subscribers he can choose up to ten different existing
      users who will also get the same subscription he subscribes into. Those
      extra subscriptions are called slaves. The changes to this user's
      subscription will be automatically applied to the slave subscriptions.
      The limits of slave subscriptions is defined per subscription level for
      maximum flexibility. This allows you to implement something like 'family
      subscriptions' which allow several members of the same family to share a
      single subscription, without having to subscribe each family member
      individually.</para>

    <para>Akeeba Subscriptions is designed to be a modular system, powered by
    standard Joomla! plugins. Using plugins you can add payment methods as
    well as integration with third party software. Moreover, core
    functionality of Akeeba Subscriptions (like sending out emails upon
    subscription or email reminders for subscription expiration) is take care
    of by plugins.</para>

    <para>Akeeba Subscriptions comes with more standard Joomla! plugins which
    accomplish a variety of tasks, from email communications to content
    filtering. These plugins belong to several groups:
    <option>akeebasubs</option>, <option>content</option>,
    <option>system</option> and <option>ccinvoices</option>. This

      <para>Akeeba Subscriptions will automatically expire your users'
      subscriptions when they visit a page with an Akeeba Subscriptions module
      on your site after their subscription expiration date. However, if you
      want subscription expiration to be performed automatically, you need to
      publish this plugin. It will fire once per day, expiring subscriptions
      past their expiration date. We strongly recommend publishing this plugin
      at all times.</para>

      <para>Since some people reading the above paragraph had gotten the wrong
      picture, let's try explaining this in even more detail. The subscription
      expiration control plugin is a Joomla! plugin. It cannot magically run
      on its own accord. The only way it will run is when a page load occurs.
      Therefore you need to have at least a handful (typically: about 10) page
      load requests per day on your site so that this plugin can be triggered
      and do its job. If you have a site with practically zero traffic you
      will have to deliberately visit it every day and browse 10-20 pages so
      that this plugin does get activated and does process expired
      subscriptions. The subscriber whose subscription has expired does not
      need to visit your site.</para>

      <para>This content plugin allows you to show parts of your content only

      <note>
        <para>The following documentation adds a space between the curly

        plugin, please DO NOT add a space between the curly braces and its
        contents. Thank you!</para>
      </note>

      <para>Its syntax is:</para>

      <programlisting>{ akeebasubs <replaceable>expression</replaceable> }Your content{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

      <para>This means that "Your content" will only be displayed to users
      whose subscriptions satisfy the <replaceable>expression</replaceable>.
      In the simplest form, expression is just the name of a subscription
      level, e.g.</para>

      <programlisting>{ akeebasubs LEVEL1 }Your content{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

      <para>If you want to present the content to someone who holds an active
      subscription to both LEVEL1 and LEVEL2, you can use the
      <option>&amp;&amp;</option> (logic and) operator:</para>

      <programlisting>{ akeebasubs LEVEL1 <option>&amp;&amp;</option> LEVEL2 }Your content{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

      <para>Likewise, you can use the || (logic or) operator to present the
      content to anyone who has a subscription to any of LEVEL3 or LEVEL4
      levels:</para>

      <programlisting>{ akeebasubs LEVEL3 <option>||</option> LEVEL4 }Your content{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

      <para>Important note: The logical OR consists of two "pipe" symbols.
      These are not the same as capital I! On a Mac's keyboard, the pipe
      symbol is present next to the ENTER key, accessible by pressing SHIFT-\.
      On most Windows/Linux machines, this key is usually somewhere near the
      ENTER key and is most likely accessible by pressing SHIFT-\ as
      well.</para>

      <para>You can also negate the logic. For example, you can present the
      content to anyone having a subscription to neither LEVEL1 nor LEVEL3 by
      using the ! (logical not) operator:</para>

      <programlisting>{ akeebasubs !LEVEL1 &amp;&amp; !LEVEL3 }Your content{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

      <para>If you specify multiple operators, the precedence is NOT, AND, OR.
      This means that the exclamation mark is processed first, the ampersands
      second and the bars last. Example:</para>

      <programlisting>{ akeebasubs !LEVEL1 || LEVEL2 &amp;&amp; !LEVEL3 }Your content{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

      <para>This means that the content will be presented to users who do not
      have a subscription to LEVEL1. Also, if they do have a LEVEL1
      subscription and they are also LEVEL2 (but not LEVEL3) subscribers the
      content will also be shown to them.</para>

      <tip>
        <para>Since Akeeba Subscriptions 1.0 Stable you can also use a
        pseudo-level marked by a single star (*) which matches all active
        subscriptions. For example, to show something to all subscribers
        use:</para>

        <programlisting>{ akeebasubs * }Content to show to all subscribers{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

        <para>Additionally, you can use the "not" modifier (exclamation mark)
        to show content only to non-subscribers:</para>

        <programlisting>{ akeebasubs !* }Content to show to non-subscribers{ /akeebasubs }</programlisting>

        <para>You can use this trick to easily show different messages to
        subscribers and non-subscribers, no matter if you have decided on the
        final list or naming of your subscription levels.</para>
      </tip>

      <title>Timed content release</title>

      <para>Displayed in the Plugins Manager as: <guilabel>Content - Akeeba
      Subscriptions Timed Release</guilabel></para>

      <para>This content plugin allows you to show parts of your content only
      to specific subscribers, depending on how many days they are on
      particular subscription levels, or how many days remain in their
      subscription to perticular subscription levels. This is a very powerful
      feature that allows you to "drip feed" information to your
      subscribers.</para>

      <para>Practical use case: e-Learning sites. On an e-learning site a user
      usually subscribes to a course which lasts for weeks. Typically, you
      only want your student to see certain information every few days/weeks,
      disallowing them to peek through to the end of the course. This plugin
      will help do exactly that.</para>

      <para>Another practical use case: showing coupon codes to your
      subscribers as the end of their subscription expiration comes near, e.g.
      during the last 30 days of their subscription.</para>

      <note>
        <para>Like the content restriction plugin, it cannot "hide" entire
        articles, e.g. not show them at all to people outside the specified
        time constraints. At best, only the title will be shown.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Its syntax is:</para>

      <programlisting>{astimedrelease <replaceable>expression</replaceable> }Your content{/astimedrelease}</programlisting>

      <para>This means that "Your content" will only be displayed to users
      whose subscriptions satisfy the <replaceable>expression</replaceable>.
      In the simplest form, expression is just the name of a subscription
      level, e.g.</para>

      <programlisting>{astimedrelease LEVEL1}Your content{/astimedrelease}</programlisting>

      <para>In this form it will only show the content if the user has or has
      ever had a subscription on the LEVEL1 subscription level. It gets
      infinitely more useful appending time expressions after the subscription
      level.</para>

      <para>Time expressions follow the subscription level, are enclosed in
      parentheses and consist of one or two arguments. Since it's hard to
      explain this otherwise, let's take some examples:</para>

      </variablelist>

      <para>You can create complex situations involving multiple checks using
      the &amp;&amp; (and) and || (or) operators. For example:</para>

      <programlisting>{astimedrelease LEVEL1(X,10) &amp;&amp; LEVEL2(-10)}Your content{/astimedrelease}</programlisting>

      <para>means that the user must be in his first 10 days of a LEVEL1
      subscription and his last 10 days of a LEVEL2 subscription (but not one
      without the other also being true). Conversely:</para>

      <programlisting>{astimedrelease LEVEL1(X,10) &amp;&amp; LEVEL2(-10)}Your content{/astimedrelease}</programlisting>

      <para>means that the user must be in his first 10 days of a LEVEL1
      subscription or his last 10 days of a LEVEL2 subscription (or
      both).</para>

      <para>Moreover you can use the ! (not) operator to negate the effect of
      an expression. For example:</para>

      <programlisting>{astimedrelease LEVEL1(X,10) &amp;&amp; !LEVEL2(-10)}Your content{/astimedrelease}</programlisting>

      <para>means that the user must be in his first 10 days of a LEVEL1
      subscription but not his last 10 days of a LEVEL2 subscription.</para>

      <important>
        <para>he logical OR consists of two "pipe" symbols. These are not the
        same as capital I! On a Mac's keyboard, the pipe symbol is present
        next to the ENTER key, accessible by pressing SHIFT-\. On most
        Windows/Linux machines, this key is usually somewhere near the ENTER
        key and is most likely accessible by pressing SHIFT-\ as well.</para>
      </important>

      <note>
        <para>This plugin does a "smart calculation" of the time the user has
        a subscription on a particular level. It sums up the time he has
        consumed for all of his subscriptions on that level to date, including
        expired subscriptions.</para>

        <para>For example a user has two subscriptions: LEVEL1 from 1/1/2012
        to 31/1/2012, expired. LEVEL1 from 15/3/2012 to 15/4/2102, active.
        Assuming that the current date is April 1st, 2012 the user's
        calculated time on LEVEL1 is 46 days: 31 days from his expired
        subscription and 15 days from his current subscription.</para>

        <para>Similarly the number of days till the subscription expiration
        are calculated based on the expiration date of the last expiring paid
        subscription of the user on that level, one which may not be active
        yet.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Moreover, the plugin allows you to display the number of days a
      user has accumulated on a subscription level and how many days remain
      until his subscription expires:</para>

      <programlisting>{asdayselapsed LEVEL1}</programlisting>

      <para>shows how many days the user has had subscriptions for the LEVEL1
      subscription level.</para>

      <programlisting>{asdaysremaining LEVEL1}</programlisting>

      <para>shows how many days remain until the users subscription to LEVEL1
      expires.</para>

      <para>You can also append a comma and a number to add/remove a number of
      days. For example:</para>

      <programlisting>{asdaysremaining LEVEL1,-10}</programlisting>

      <para>shows how many days remain until the users subscription to LEVEL1
      expires, minus 10 days. This feature is useful for displaying the number
      of days left before you allow your user to view some timed release
      content.</para>

      <para>Displayed in the Plugins Manager as: <guilabel>Content - Akeeba
      Subscriptions Link</guilabel></para>

      <para>The purpose of the aslink plugin is to produce URLs to
      subscription pages if you give it the name of the subscription level,
      its URL or its numeric ID.</para>

      <note>
        <para>The following documentation adds a space between the curly
        brackets ({ and }). This is done in order for Joomla! not to process
        the documentation text as plugin instructions. When you use the
        plugin, please DO NOT add a space between the curly braces and its
        contents. Thank you!</para>
      </note>

      <para>The aslink plugin only produces a URL, not a link. In order to
      create a link, select the text you want to link, click on your WYSIWYG
      editor's link button and when it asks you for a URL, enter the plugin
      code, as shown below.</para>

      <para>Syntax:</para>

      <programlisting>{ aslink MYLEVEL }</programlisting>

      <para>Returns the URL to a subscription level called "MYLEVEL", e.g.
      <uri>http://localhost/component/akeebasubs/new/mylevel?layout=default</uri>.</para>

      <programlisting>{ aslink mylevel }</programlisting>

      <para>Returns the URL to a subscription level whose slug is "mylevel",
      e.g.
      <uri>http://localhost/component/akeebasubs/new/mylevel?layout=default</uri>.</para>

      <programlisting>{ aslink 2 }</programlisting>

      <para>Returns the URL to a subscription level whose numeric ID is 2,
      e.g.
      <uri>http://localhost/component/akeebasubs/new/mylevel?layout=default</uri>.</para>

      <para>In order to find the numeric ID of a level, please go to your
      site's back-end, <guimenu>Components</guimenu>, <guisubmenu>Akeeba
      Subscriptions</guisubmenu>, <guimenuitem>Subscription
      Levels</guimenuitem> and click on the name of the subscription level you
      want. Note the URL in the browser. It's something like
      <uri>http://localhost/administrator/index.php?option=com_akeebasubs&amp;view=level&amp;id=2</uri>.
      The number after &amp;id= is the numeric ID of the level. In this
      example, the numeric ID is 2.</para>

      <para>Moreover, you can use the following syntax:</para>

      <programlisting>{ aslink view=levels }</programlisting>

      <para>to create a link to the Subscription Levels view. This is usually
      quicker than creating a link to a menu item and remembering to change
      that link whenever your menu structure changes.</para>

      <para>This plugin allows you to have your users fill in a CAPTCHA before
      they can subscribe to your site. This is a good measure to prevent
      automated/bulk registrations, especially if you offer free or trial
      subscriptions. The CAPTCHA is provided by <link
      xlink:href="http://www.ReCAPTCHA.net">ReCAPTCHA.net</link>. You will
      need to have created a ReCAPTCHA account before using this
      plugin.</para>

      </tip>

      <important>
        <para>Showing a CAPTCHA on your subscription page will result in many
        lost sales. By showing a CAPTCHA in the subscription page you are
        making your potential subscribers to think hard before they part with
        their money, as well as frustrate them (according to our experience,
        one in two CAPTCHAs is unsolvable and makes the user feel they are
        stupid). As any undergrad business school student can tell you, the
        more you make people think, the less likely they are to pay. Besides,
        if someone actually pays you he is certainly not a spammer, therefore
        the CAPTCHA is unnecessary.</para>

        <para>We strongly advise you <emphasis role="bold">AGAINST</emphasis>
        using this plugin. If you decide to use it, you should limit its
        display only to free or trial subscriptions using the "Enable on these
        levels" option described below. You can always ignore our advice to
        your business' detriment.</para>

      </note>

      <para>Joomla! normally provides its own page to allow your visitors to
      become (free) members of the site. Many of our clients have told us that
      they do not want that and would rather use Akeeba Subscriptions and a
      free subscription level to do that. Or that they don't want anyone to be
      able to register for a free user account. The problem is that Joomla!'s
      login module –and most third party login modules– will display a "Create
      account" link leading to that Joomla! page if user registration is
      enabled in Joomla!. At the same time, Akeeba Subscriptions won't work if
      user registration is disabled in Joomla!. Sounds like a chicken and egg
      issue.</para>

      <para>Not any more! The <guilabel>System - User Registration Redirection
      to Akeeba Subscriptions</guilabel> plugin is here to provide the missing
      feature: automatically redirect anyone trying to access Joomla!'s user
      registration page to Akeeba Subscriptions. Moreover, this plugin allows
      you to redirect the visitors to a custom URL, for example a page where
      you explain that there are no free memberships on your site and provide
      more information about subscriptions.</para>

      <para>The options of the plugin are:</para>

        <varlistentry>

    <title>Scheduling information</title>

    <para>Akeeba Subscriptions needs to run some housekeeping tasks, such as
    checking subscriptions for expiration, in regular intervals. As you've
    read earlier on, this can be performed by means of system plugins. These
    plugins have the downside of increasing the page load time of your site.
    That's why since Akeeba Subscriptions 3.2.1 we've added CRON
    support.</para>

    <para>The CRON jobs are designed to make use of the same housekeeping
    plugins. Instead of having the plugins activate in random page loads,
    making your site appear slow to some of your visitors, the CRON support
    consists of a special URL which immediately triggers those plugins. This
    means that for the next 24 hours these housekeeping plugins won't run
    during regular site traffic and your site won't appear any slower. We
    strongly recommend setting up CRON jobs which run at least twice daily
    (every 12 hours) or more often (ideally: every 30 minutes) to maximise the
    performance benefits for your site.</para>

    <section xml:id="scheduling-activate">
      <title>Activating the scheduling URL</title>

      <para>The scheduling URL comes deactivated by default. This is a
      security setting: having this feature activated out of the box would
      allow a malicious user to hit it repeatedly, slowing down your server
      and adversely impacting your site. The first thing you have to do is to
      activate it, by providing a secret key in the components Options
      page.</para>

      <para>Log in to your site's back-end. Go to
      <guimenu>Components</guimenu>, <guimenuitem>Akeeba
      Subscriptions</guimenuitem>. Click on the <guibutton>Options</guibutton>
      button. Click on the <guilabel>Front-end Display</guilabel> tab. You
      will now see the option called <guilabel>CRON secret key</guilabel>
      towards the top. Enter a secret word that you only know and is different
      than the passwords you use for logging in to your site, your hosting
      account and so on. The key must consist only of the lowercase letters
      a-z and numbers 0-9. Note that down; you will need to use it in the
      scheduling URL. Now click on the <guibutton>Save &amp; Close</guibutton>
      button.</para>

      <para>The CRON URL will now only work when the correct secret key is
      present in the URL. This prevents malicious users from hitting this URL
      repeatedly. We recommend keeping the secret key to yourself, for
      security reasons.</para>

      <para>If you ever want to disable that feature again just repeat the
      previous steps but leave the box empty. Having it empty automatically
      disables the CRON URL.</para>

      <section xml:id="scheduling-implementation">
        <title>Scheduling the housekeeping</title>

        <para>The exact method of scheduling depends on your host.</para>

        <bridgehead>The host allows you to enter URLs to be called
        periodically</bridgehead>

        <para>This is the most straightforward implementation. Just enter the
        CRON URL and make sure it's called at least twice per day
        (recommended: every 30 minutes).</para>

        <bridgehead>Scheduling using your hosting control panel</bridgehead>

        <para>Most hosts offer a CPanel of some kind. There has to be a
        section for something like "<guilabel>CRON Jobs</guilabel>",
        "<guilabel>scheduled tasks</guilabel>" and the like. The help screen
        in there describes how to set up a scheduled job. One missing part for
        you would be the command to issue. Simply putting the URL in there is
        not going to work.</para>

        <para>If you are on a UNIX-style OS host (usually, a Linux host) you
        most probably have access to a command line utility called
        <command>wget</command>. It's almost trivial to use:</para>

        <para><command>wget
        "http://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_akeebasubs&amp;view=cron&amp;secret=YourSecret&amp;command=YourCommand"</command></para>

        <warning>
          <para>Do not forget to put the URL inside double quotes. If you
          don't the CRON job will fail! The reason is that the ampersand is
          also used to separate multiple commands in a single command line. If
          you don't use the double quotes at the start and end of the CRON
          URL, your host will think that you tried to run multiple commands
          and load your site's homepage instead of Akeeba Subscriptions' CRON
          URL.</para>
        </warning>

        <para>If you're unsure, check with your host. Sometimes you have to
        get from them the full path to wget in order for CRON to work, thus
        turning the above command line to something like:</para>

        <para><command>/usr/bin/wget
        "http://www.example.com/index.php?option=com_akeebasubs&amp;view=cron&amp;secret=YourSecret&amp;command=YourCommand"</command></para>

        <para>Contact your host; they usually have a nifty help page for all
        this stuff.</para>

        <para><systemitem>wget</systemitem> is multi-platform command line
        utility program which is not included with all operating systems. If
        your system does not include the <systemitem>wget</systemitem>
        command, it can be downloaded at this address: <link
        xlink:href="http://wget.addictivecode.org/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#download">http://wget.addictivecode.org/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#download</link>.

        xlink:href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/wget.html</link>.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>The ampersands above should be written as a single ampersand,
          not as an HTML entity (&amp;amp;). Failure to do so will result in a
          403: Forbidden error message and the CRON job won't run. This is not
          a bug, it's the way wget works.</para>
        </warning>

        <bridgehead>Using the front-end backup in SiteGround and other hosts
        using cURL instead of wget</bridgehead>

        <para>As one of our users pointed out in the support forum, finding
        the correct command to issue for the CRON job is tricky. What he
        writes applies not only to his host, SiteGround, but many other
        commercial hosts as well. We'll simply quote our user, bzcoder.</para>

        <para>In the CPanel for SiteGround there is a cronjob option, you
        create a cronjob using that and use:</para>

        <para><command>curl -b /tmp/cookies.txt -c /tmp/cookies.txt -L
        --max-redirs 1000 -v "<replaceable>url</replaceable>"</command></para>

        <para>as your command.</para>

        <para>Replace <replaceable>url</replaceable> with your CRON
        URL.</para>

        <bridgehead>Scheduling using WebCron.org</bridgehead>

        <para>We consider using WebCron.org the simplest method. The cost
        depends on how often you run the Akeeba Subscriptions CRON jobs. With
        twice daily runs the cost is between one to two Euros <emphasis>per
        year</emphasis>. Considering that you need to use CRON jobs for
        performance reasons only when you sell hundreds of subscriptions per
        year we consider that to be extremely cost effective.</para>

        <para>Assuming that you have already bought some credits on
        webcron.org, here's how to automate your Akeeba Subscriptions CRON
        jobs using their service.</para>

        <para>Log in to webcron.org. In the CRON area, click on the

    <title>Akeeba Subscriptions' modules</title>

    <para>Akeeba Subscriptions comes with a variety of modules to display
    customized lists of subscription levels or a list of a user's
    subscriptions. Make sure you visit your Module Manager page and have a
    look at them. You can create interesting effects, like a customized and
    categorized subscriptions list page, out of those modules.</para>

    <section xml:id="modules-list-of-active-subs">
      <title>List of active subscriptions</title>

      <para>Displayed in the Modules Manager as: <guilabel>Akeeba
      Subscriptions - List of active subscriptions</guilabel></para>

      <para>This is extremely simple plugin will merely list the current
      user's active subscriptions as an unordered list. It is meant as an
      example of how you can create custom modules for Akeeba
      Subscriptions.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="modules-list-sub-levels">
      <title>List subscription levels</title>

      <para>Displayed in the Modules Manager as: <guilabel>Akeeba
      Subscriptions - List subscription levels</guilabel></para>

      <para>This extremely powerful module allows you to present a list of all
      or specific subscription levels, using either layout, in any module
      position on your site. Combined with Joomla!'s { loadposition } plugin
      you can use this module to assemble the perfect presentation page of
      your subscriptions, grouped any way you please.</para>

      <para>The module has only two options:</para>

      <variablelist>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Subscription Levels</term>

          <listitem>
            <para>Choose which subscription level(s) to display in the module.
            This is a multiple-selection list. You can use CTRL-click
            (Windows, Linux) or CMD-click (Mac OS X) to select multiple items
            on the list.</para>

  <chapter xml:id="devinfo">
    <title>Developers' information</title>

    <para>Akeeba Subscriptions was designed to be very extensible right from
    its inception. Everything can be accomplished using plugins which can be
    installed through the familiar Joomla! extensions installer.</para>

    <para>The plugins can belong to one of two groups:</para>

    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term>akeebasubs</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>This is the plugin group where all integrations live. Plugins
          in this group can implement a plethora of methods which allows them
          to be notified when a subscription's status changes, when the user
          information is read/written and much more.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term>akpayment</term>

        <listitem>
          <para>This plugin group is used by Akeeba Subscriptions payment
          plugins. Plugins in this group implement special methods which
          allows them to be notified of the user's intention to pay for a
          subscription, as well as process the payment notification by the
          payment processor and, in turn, let the component know.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>

    <para>The rest of this chapter documents the various plugin events in each
    group. References to existing plugins are made so that you can understand
    how things really work.</para>

    <section xml:id="dev-akeebasubs">
      <title>The "akeebasubs" plugin events</title>

      <para>Since Akeeba Subscriptions 3.5.0 we recommend developers wishing
      to create plugins for Akeeba Subscriptions to place them in the
      <filename>akeebasubs</filename> directory.</para>

      <para>Moreover, we have created a base class,
      <code>plgAkeebasubsAbstract</code>, which can make your life simpler.
      You are suggested to use code like the following to create your custom
      plugins:</para>

      <programlisting>&lt;?php
defined('_JEXEC') or die();

$akeebasubsinclude = include_once JPATH_ADMINISTRATOR.'/components/com_akeebasubs/assets/akeebasubs.php';
if(!$akeebasubsinclude) { unset($akeebasubsinclude); return; } else { unset($akeebasubsinclude); }

class plgAkeebasubsMycustomplugin extends plgAkeebasubsAbstract
{
    // your code goes here
}</programlisting>

      <para>This allows you to use our base class. In the event that a user
      enables the plugin without having a post-3.5.0 Akeeba Subscriptions
      version installed the plugin will not load, therefore not causing a
      fatal PHP error.</para>

      <section xml:id="dev-onAKSubscriptionChange">
        <title>onAKSubscriptionChange</title>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Prototype</emphasis>: <code>public
        function onAKSubscriptionChange($row, $info)</code></para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Synopsis</emphasis>: This event is called
        whenever a subscription is created or modified.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Sample plugin</emphasis>:
        plugins/akeebasubs/subscriptionemails.php</para>

        <para>The <code>$row</code> variable contains a JTable descendant
        which gives you access to all of the information in the subscription
        record (#__akeebasubs_subscriptions table's fields). The
        <code>$info</code> variable contains a hash array with useful
        information, including a copy of table before and after the
        modification, the modified rows and the kind of modification (new for
        new record or modified for a modified existing record) that took
        place.</para>

        <para>You cannot change the information in $row or pass data back to
        the component in any way. In fact, this event is called immediately
        after all information has been written to the database.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="dev-onAKUserRefresh">
        <title>onAKUserRefresh</title>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Prototype</emphasis>: <code>public
        function onAKUserRefresh($user_id)</code></para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Synopsis</emphasis>: This event is called
        when the user clicks on the "Refresh Integrations" button in the
        back-end of the Akeeba Subscriptions component. It is called once per
        each subscriber. The $user_id variable contains the numeric Joomla!
        user ID of the subscriber.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Sample plugin</emphasis>:
        plugins/akeebasubs/joomla.php</para>

        <para>You might consider it odd that the event is called per user
        instead of per subscription. However, the integrations in Akeeba
        Subscriptions are "smart". This means that instead of triggering
        functionality based on the enabled status of an individual
        subscription they work based on the enabled status of all
        subscriptions. This allows you to have rules like "if the user has
        SUB1 and SUB2, do this" or "if the user has SUB1 and had a SUB2 but it
        has now expired, do that". Looking at the sample plugin's code you can
        understand how the iteration of the user's subscriptions is made and
        how a plugin can determine which subscription levels the user belongs
        to.</para>

      <section xml:id="dev-onSubscriptionFormRender">
        <title>onSubscriptionFormRender</title>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Prototype</emphasis>: <code>public

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Synopsis</emphasis>: This event is called
        when the subscription form (front-end, view=level) is displayed. It
        returns an array of extra fields which will be rendered in the form,
        right below the email field and before the address fields.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Sample plugin</emphasis>:
        plugins/akeebasubs/samplefields.php</para>

        <para>The input of this event's method is two variables:</para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>$userparams</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>This is a copy of the user's record, as stored in the
              #__akeebasubs_users table, in object format. You can access the
              data in the user record as, for example,
              <code>$userparams-&gt;address1</code> in order to get the
              Address 1 field's contents.</para>

              <para>The most important -for you- part of this object is
              <code>$userparams-&gt;params</code> which stores all the extra
              fields' values. For example, if you have defined a field named
              foobar, you can get its stored value as
              <code>$userparams-&gt;params-&gt;foobar</code>.</para>

              <important>
                <para>This object contains the data stored in the database.
                When the user modified this data in the interface and submits
                the form (but the form is invalid) the information in this
                object IS NOT UPDATED. In this case, use the
                <code>$cache</code> variable.</para>

              <para>When the user submits the subscription forms but it is
              invalid (errors don't allow it to pass the validation), Akeeba
              Subscriptions stores the user's modified data in the $cache

        <bridgehead>Returning custom field definitions</bridgehead>

        <para>The return of this event is an array which consists of one or

        <bridgehead>Javascript validation</bridgehead>

        <para>Akeeba Subscriptions does not make any attempt to validate the
        custom fields and update the display status of the valid/invalid
        labels. It is your responsibility. In this event, you can call
        <code>JFactory::getDocument()-&gt;addScriptDeclaration($scriptData)</code>
        where $scriptData is the Javascript validation code.</para>

        <para>In order to make it easier for you, Akeeba Subscriptions offers
        an architecture similar to an observer pattern in the Javascript code.
        You can have Javascript functions called when Akeeba Subscriptions'
        Javascript code is fetching the contents of the fields before sending
        a data validation request through AJAX and another function which is
        called when the validation results are being processed. You can add
        the former to the stack using addToValidationFetchQueue() and the
        latter using addToValidationQueue().</para>

        <para>Please look at the very well documented sample plugin for more
        information regarding all of the above.</para>

        <bridgehead>Javascript validation</bridgehead>

        <para>Akeeba Subscriptions does not make any attempt to validate the
        custom fields and update the display status of the valid/invalid
        labels. It is your responsibility. In this event, you can call
        <code>JFactory::getDocument()-&gt;addScriptDeclaration($scriptData)</code>
        where $scriptData is the Javascript validation code.</para>

        <para>In order to make it easier for you, Akeeba Subscriptions offers
        an architecture similar to an observer pattern in the Javascript code.
        You can have Javascript functions called when Akeeba Subscriptions'
        Javascript code is fetching the contents of the fields before sending
        a data validation request through AJAX and another function which is
        called when the validation results are being processed. You can add
        the former to the stack using addToSubValidationFetchQueue() and the
        latter using addToSubValidationQueue().</para>

        <para>Please look at the very well documented slavesubs plugin for
        more information regarding all of the above.</para>
